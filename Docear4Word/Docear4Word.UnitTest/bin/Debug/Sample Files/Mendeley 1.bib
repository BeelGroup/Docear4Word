@inproceedings{Yilmaz06,
abstract = {We consider the problem of evaluating retrieval systems using

incomplete judgment information. Buckley and Voorhees

recently demonstrated that retrieval systems can be efficiently

and effectively evaluated using incomplete judgments

via the bpref measure [6]. When relevance judgments are

complete, the value of bpref is an approximation to the

value of average precision using complete judgments. However,

when relevance judgments are incomplete, the value of

bpref deviates from this value, though it continues to rank

systems in a manner similar to average precision evaluated

with a complete judgment set. In this work, we propose

three evaluation measures that (1) are approximations to

average precision even when the relevance judgments are incomplete

and (2) are more robust to incomplete or imperfect

relevance judgments than bpref. The proposed estimates of

average precision are simple and accurate, and we demonstrate

the utility of these estimates using TREC data.},

abstract = {In debates about journals, their publishers and the future of both,
it is important to be clear about what we are discussing. In this
article, the sparse existing literature is surveyed, and original
sources examined to provide further detail. The membership lists
of six leading publishing associations, and the websites of their
members, were also studied. More than half of all peer-reviewed journals
in Ulrich's are published by or on behalf ofin association with nonprofit
organizations. Other than the top few commercial publishers, there
is little difference in size between the two types; the 'long tail'
of publishers are small and therefore vulnerable, and yet most are
not represented by any trade association. The majority of journals
come from the USA or the UK. Nonprofits launch fewer new journals,
but are also less likely to close journals. The quality advantage
of nonprofit journals may be reducing, but nonprofit journals still
predominate among the most highly cited journals.},

information systems majors at an eastern state university in 1999
and 2004. The often-cited proposition that the level of student academic
dishonesty among college and university students is increasing was
unsupported. While the level of participation in one practice increased
between 1999 and 2004, the level decreased for three practices. Little
difference was found in the reasons for participation. It was discovered
that both participation and reasons for participation were much more
dependent on the student characteristics of GPA, gender, and class
rank in 2004 than in 1999, suggesting that efforts to reduce student
academic dishonesty among MIS majors need to be more focused on particular
types of students.},

abstract = {<sec> <title>Background<title> <p>Computational methods have been
used to find duplicate biomedical publications in MEDLINE. Full text
articles are becoming increasingly available, yet the similarities
among them have not been systematically studied. Here, we quantitatively
investigated the full text similarity of biomedical publications
in PubMed Central.<p> <sec><sec> <title>MethodologyPrincipal Findings<title>
<p>72,011 full text articles from PubMed Central (PMC) were parsed
to generate three different datasets: full texts, sections, and paragraphs.
Text similarity comparisons were performed on these datasets using
the text similarity algorithm eTBLAST. We measured the frequency
of similar text pairs and compared it among different datasets. We
found that high abstract similarity can be used to predict high full
text similarity with a specificity of 20.1\% (95\% CI [17.3\%, 23.1\%])
and sensitivity of 99.999\%. Abstract similarity and full text similarity
have a moderate correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient: \^{a}ˆ’0.423)
when the similarity ratio is above 0.4. Among pairs of articles in
PMC, method sections are found to be the most repetitive (frequency
of similar pairs, methods: 0.029, introduction: 0.0076, results:
0.0043). In contrast, among a set of manually verified duplicate
articles, results are the most repetitive sections (frequency of
similar pairs, results: 0.94, methods: 0.89, introduction: 0.82).
Repetition of introduction and methods sections is more likely to
be committed by the same authors (odds of a highly similar pair having
at least one shared author, introduction: 2.31, methods: 1.83, results:
1.03). There is also significantly more similarity in pairs of review
articles than in pairs containing one review and one nonreview paper
(frequency of similar pairs: 0.0167 and 0.0023, respectively).<p>
<sec><sec> <title>ConclusionSignificance<title> <p>While quantifying
abstract similarity is an effective approach for finding duplicate
citations, a comprehensive full text analysis is necessary to uncover
all potential duplicate citations in the scientific literature and
is helpful when establishing ethical guidelines for scientific publications.<p>

abstract = {Recent, well-publicized scandals, involving unethical conduct have
rekindled interest in academic misconduct. Prior studies of academic
misconduct have focussed exclusively on situational factors (e.g.,
integrity culture, honor codes), demographic variables or personality
constructs. We contend that it is important to also examine how these
classes of variables interact to influence perceptions of and intentions
relating to academic misconduct. In a sample of 217 business students,
we examined how integrity culture interacts with Prudence and Adjustment
to explain variance in estimated frequency of cheating, suspicions
of cheating, considering cheating and reporting cheating. Age, integrity
culture, and personality variables were significantly related to
different criteria. Overall, personality variables explained the
most unique variance in academic misconduct, and Adjustment interacted
with integrity culture, such that integrity culture had more influence
on intentions to cheat for less well-adjusted individuals. Implications
for practice are discussed and future research directions are offered.},

published from 1990 to 2000. Of the eight databases, Google Scholar
indexes the greatest number of core articles (93\%) and provides the
most uniform publisher and date coverage. It covers 27\% more core
articles than the second-ranked database (SSCI) and 2.4 times as
many as the lowest-ranked database (GEOBASE). At the same time, a
substantial proportion of the citations provided by Google Scholar
are incomplete (32\%) or presented without abstracts (33\%)},

abstract = {The string-matching field has grown at a such complicated stage that
various issues come into play when studying it: data structure and
algorithmic design, database principles, compression techniques,
architectural features, cache and prefetching policies. The expertise
nowadays required to design good string data structures and algorithms
is therefore transversal to many computer science fields and much
more study on the orchestration of known, or novel, techniques is
needed to make progress in this fascinating topic. This survey is
aimed at illustrating the key ideas which should constitute, in our
opinion, the current background of every index designer. We also
discuss the positive features and drawback of known indexing schemes
and algorithms, and devote much attention to detail research issues
and open problems both on the theoretical and the experimental side.},

information assets far outstrips our ability to exploit and protect

management challenges as they seek to: improve information awareness

share information with warfighters and allies; and root out malicious
insiders. One means to mitigating these challenges is to provide
reliable knowledge of the provenance (i.e., lineage) of documents.
This knowledge would allow, for instance, analysts to identify source

on the human-eye approach by identifying similarities which a tutor
might otherwise miss, thus saving investigative time. VAST is demonstrated
using noise-free synthetic texts and actual student submissions containing
intra-corpal plagiarism. Associated ideas, including similarity visualisations,
similarity intersections and the ldquo;four-stage plagiarism detection

@inproceedings{Yilmaz08,
abstract = {In the field of information retrieval, one is often faced with

the problem of computing the correlation between two ranked

lists. The most commonly used statistic that quantifies this

correlation is Kendall’s  . Often times, in the information

retrieval community, discrepancies among those items having

high rankings are more important than those among

items having low rankings. The Kendall’s  statistic, however,

does not make such distinctions and equally penalizes

errors both at high and low rankings.

In this paper, we propose a new rank correlation coefficient,

AP correlation (ap), that is based on average precision

and has a probabilistic interpretation. We show that

the proposed statistic gives more weight to the errors at high

rankings and has nice mathematical properties which make

it easy to interpret. We further validate the applicability of

the statistic using experimental data.},

@inproceedings{Ley2006,
abstract = {CiteSeer and Google-Scholar are huge digital libraries which provide
access to (computer-)science publications. Both collections are operated
like specialized search engines, they crawl the web with little human
intervention and analyse the documents to classifiy them and to extract
some metadata from the full texts. On the other hand there are traditional
bibliographic data bases like INSPEC for engineering and PubMed for
medicine. For the field of computer science the DBLP service evolved
from a small specialized bibliography to a digital library covering
most subfields of computer science. The collections of the second
group are maintained with massive human effort. On the long term
this investment is only justified if data quality of the manually
maintained collections remains much higher than that of the search
engine style collections. In this paper we discuss management and
algorithmic issues of data quality. We focus on the special problem
of person names.},

abstract = {To support biomedical experts in their knowledge discovery process, we have developed a literature mining method called RaJoLink for identification of relations between biomedical concepts in disconnected sets of articles. The method implements Swanson's ABC model approach for generating hypotheses in a new way. The main novelty is a semi-automated suggestion of candidates for agents a that might be logically connected with a given phenomenon c under investigation. The choice of candidates for a is based on rare terms identified in the literature on c. As rare terms are not part of the typical range of information, which describe the phenomenon under investigation, such information might be considered as unusual observations about the phenomenon c. If literatures on these rare terms have an interesting term in common, this joint term is declared as a candidate for a. Linking terms b between literature on a and literature on c are then searched for in the closed discovery to provide additional supportive evidence for uncovered connections. We have applied the method to the literature on autism and have used MEDLINE as a source of data. Expert evaluation has confirmed that the discovered relations might contribute to a better understanding of autism.},

abstract = {We present randomized algorithms to solve the following string-matching
problem and some of its generalizations: Given a string X of length
n (the pattern) and a string Y (the text), find the first occurrence
of X as a consecutive block within Y. The algorithms represent strings
of length n by much shorter strings called fingerprints, and achieve
their efficiency by manipulating fingerprints instead of longer strings.
The algorithms require a constant number of storage locations, and
essentially run in real time. They are conceptually simple and easy
to implement. The method readily generalizes to higher-dimensional
pattern-matching problems.},

@article{Wren2004,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: New relationships are often implicit from existing information, but the amount and growth of published literature limits the scope of analysis an individual can accomplish. Our goal was to develop and test a computational method to identify relationships within scientific reports, such that large sets of relationships between unrelated items could be sought out and statistically ranked for their potential relevance as a set. RESULTS: We first construct a network of tentative relationships between 'objects' of biomedical research interest (e.g. genes, diseases, phenotypes, chemicals) by identifying their co-occurrences within all electronically available MEDLINE records. Relationships shared by two unrelated objects are then ranked against a random network model to estimate the statistical significance of any given grouping. When compared against known relationships, we find that this ranking correlates with both the probability and frequency of object co-occurrence, demonstrating the method is well suited to discover novel relationships based upon existing shared relationships. To test this, we identified compounds whose shared relationships predicted they might affect the development and/or progression of cardiac hypertrophy. When laboratory tests were performed in a rodent model, chlorpromazine was found to reduce the progression of cardiac hypertrophy.},

abstract = {Authorship attribution supported by statistical or computational methods
has a long history starting from the 19th century and is marked by
the seminal study of Mosteller and Wallace (1964) on the authorship
of the disputed “Federalist Papers.” During the last decade, this
scientific field has been developed substantially, taking advantage
of research advances in areas such as machine learning, information
retrieval, and natural language processing. The plethora of available
electronic texts (e.g., e-mail messages, online forum messages, blogs,
source code, etc.) indicates a wide variety of applications of this
technology, provided it is able to handle short and noisy text from
multiple candidate authors. In this article, a survey of recent advances
of the automated approaches to attributing authorship is presented,
examining their characteristics for both text representation and
text classification. The focus of this survey is on computational
requirements and settings rather than on linguistic or literary issues.
We also discuss evaluation methodologies and criteria for authorship
attribution studies and list open questions that will attract future
work in this area.},

abstract = {Claremont McKenna College has conducted a survey of faculty,


students, and relevant support staff to determine satisfaction levels
with several 

ant-plagiarism tools. Students were asked to compare learning products
from 

Glatt, Turnitin.com, and Prentice Hall, and high-profile plagiarism
education 

websites at Indiana University, Purdue, and University of Michigan.
Faculty 

and support staff were asked to compare plagiarism detection services
from 

Turnitin.com, Canexus (Eve2), and the University of Virginia (WCopyFind).


Students reported a statistically significant preference for learning
tools offered 

by Prentice Hall, Purdue, Michigan, and Turnitin.com, over those offered
by 

Glatt and Indiana. With less statistical significance, students preferred
the tools 

available at Prentice Hall overall. Faculty reported a significant
preference for 

detection services through Turnitin.com over those offered by the
University of 

Virginia software, and by the Eve2 program. 


Parallel to the collection of survey data regarding the software,
instructors in the 

Literature Department have been testing a combination of Turnitin.com’s


detection services, and Prentice Hall’s educational software. Results
of this 

program are still preliminary, but indicate a pattern of support for
the findings of 

the survey results. After one semester of employment, the program

abstract = {Motivation: The biological literature is a major repository of knowledge.
Many biological databases draw much of their content from a careful
curation of this literature. However, as the volume of literature
increases, the burden of curation increases. Text mining may provide
useful tools to assist in the curation process. To date, the lack
of standards has made it impossible to determine whether text mining
techniques are sufficiently mature to be useful.Results: We report
on a Challenge Evaluation task that we created for the Knowledge
Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) Challenge Cup. We provided a training
corpus of 862 articles consisting of journal articles curated in
FlyBase, along with the associated lists of genes and gene products,
as well as the relevant data fields from FlyBase. For the test, we
provided a corpus of 213 new (‚\"{A}\`{o}blind‚\"{A}\^{o}) articles; the 18 participating
groups provided systems that flagged articles for curation, based
on whether the article contained experimental evidence for gene expression
products. We report on the evaluation results and describe the techniques
used by the top performing groups.Contact: asy@mitre.orgKeywords:

search for the source of a document to be carried out efficiently.
There is a Zipfian distribution of word frequencies in natural language,
with some words common and many words rare. If we take a group of
three words, the rarity of most of these triples is extreme. This
can be exploited to detect web pages similar to a given target document:
while a Google search for some triples from the target may return
many hits, other triples will only be found in a few documents on
the Internet. These documents may well be similar to the target,
and are certainly worth examining more closely. Initial experiments
show that this approach is very promising, and it is being implemented
in a software tool called WebFerret.},

abstract = {In many research fields such as Psychology, Linguistics, Cognitive
Science and Artificial

Intelligence, computing semantic similarity between words is an important
issue. In this

paper a new semantic similarity metric, that exploits some notions
of the feature-based

theory of similarity and translates it into the information theoretic
domain, which leverages

the notion of Information Content (IC), is presented. In particular,
the proposed metric

exploits the notion of intrinsic IC which quantifies IC values by
scrutinizing how concepts

are arranged in an ontological structure. In order to evaluate this
metric, an on line experiment

asking the community of researchers to rank a list of 65 word pairs
has been conducted.

The experiment’s web setup allowed to collect 101 similarity ratings
and to

differentiate native and non-native English speakers. Such a large
and diverse dataset

enables to confidently evaluate similarity metrics by correlating
them with human assessments.

Experimental evaluations using WordNet indicate that the proposed
metric, coupled

with the notion of intrinsic IC, yields results above the state of
the art. Moreover,

the intrinsic IC formulation also improves the accuracy of other IC-based
metrics. In order

to investigate the generality of both the intrinsic IC formulation
and proposed similarity

metric a further evaluation using the MeSH biomedical ontology has
been performed. Even

in this case significant results were obtained. The proposed metric
and several others have

been implemented in the Java WordNet Similarity Library.},

The proposed measure is based mainly on the cross-modified path length feature between the concept nodes, and two new features: (1) the common specificity of two concept nodes, and (2) the local granularity of the clusters. We also applied, for comparison purpose, five existing general English ontology-based similarity measures into the biomedical domain within UMLS. The proposed measure was evaluated relative to human experts' ratings, and compared with the existing techniques using two ontologies (MeSH and SNOMED-CT) in UMLS. The experimental results confirmed the efficiency of the proposed method, and showed that our similarity measure gives the best overall results of correlation with human ratings. We show, further, that using MeSH ontology produces better semantic correlations with human experts' scores than SNOMED-CT in all of the tested measures.},

abstract = {Reports of rapid growth in nature-based tourism and recreation add significant weight to the economic case for biodiversity conservation but seem to contradict widely voiced concerns that people are becoming increasingly isolated from nature. This apparent paradox has been highlighted by a recent study showing that on a per capita basis, visits to natural areas in the United States and Japan have declined over the last two decades. These results have been cited as evidence of "a fundamental and pervasive shift away from nature-based recreation"-but how widespread is this phenomenon? We address this question by looking at temporal trends in visitor numbers at 280 protected areas (PAs) from 20 countries. This more geographically representative dataset shows that while PA visitation (whether measured as total or per capita visit numbers) is indeed declining in the United States and Japan, it is generally increasing elsewhere. Total visit numbers are growing in 15 of the 20 countries for which we could get data, with the median national rate of change unrelated to the national rate of population growth but negatively associated with wealth. Reasons for this reversal of growth in the richest countries are difficult to pin down with existing data, but the pattern is mirrored by trends in international tourist arrivals as a whole and so may not necessarily be caused by disaffection with nature. Irrespective of the explanation, it is clear that despite important downturns in some countries, nature-related tourism is far from declining everywhere, and may still have considerable potential both to generate funds for conservation and to shape people's attitudes to the environment.},

abstract = {Social resource sharing systems are central elements of the Web 2.0
and use the same kind of lightweight knowledge representation, called
folksonomy. Their large user communities and ever-growing networks
of user-generated content have made them an attractive object of
investigation for researchers from different disciplines like Social
Network Analysis, Data Mining, Information Retrieval or Knowledge
Discovery. In this paper, we summarize and extend our work on different
aspects of this branch of Web 2.0 research, demonstrated and evaluated
within our own social bookmark and publication sharing system BibSonomy,
which is currently among the three most popular systems of its kind.
We structure this presentation along the different interaction phases
of a user with our system, coupling the relevant research questions
of each phase with the corresponding implementation issues. This
approach reveals in a systematic fashion important aspects and results
of the broad bandwidth of folksonomy research like capturing of emergent
semantics, spam detection, ranking algorithms, analogies to search
engine log data, personalized tag recommendations and information
extraction techniques. We conclude that when integrating a real-life
application like BibSonomy into research, certain constraints have
to be considered; but in general, the tight interplay between our
scientific work and the running system has made BibSonomy a valuable
platform for demonstrating and evaluating Web 2.0 research.},

a string is also called suffix array, a data structure introduced
by Manber and Myers that has numerous applications in pattern matching,
string processing, and computational biology. Though the suffix tree
of a string can be constructed in linear time and the sorted order
of suffixes derived from it, a direct algorithm for suffix sorting
is of great interest due to the space requirements of suffix trees.
Our result improves upon the best known direct algorithm for suffix
sorting, which takes O(n log n) time. We also show how to construct
suffix trees in linear time from our suffix sorting result. Apart
from being simple and applicable for alphabets not necessarily of
fixed size, this method of constructing suffix trees is more space
efficient.},

similarity called pmra that underlies the related article search
feature in PubMed. Whether or not a document is about a particular
topic is computed from term frequencies, modeled as Poisson distributions.
Unlike previous probabilistic retrieval models, we do not attempt
to estimate relevance-but rather our focus is "relatedness", the
probability that a user would want to examine a particular document
given known interest in another. We also describe a novel technique
for estimating parameters that does not require human relevance judgments;
instead, the process is based on the existence of MeSH (R) in MEDLINE
(R).RESULTS:The pmra retrieval model was compared against bm25, a
competitive probabilistic model that shares theoretical similarities.
Experiments using the test collection from the TREC 2005 genomics
track shows a small but statistically significant improvement of
pmra over bm25 in terms of precision.CONCLUSION:Our experiments suggest
that the pmra model provides an effective ranking algorithm for related
article search.},

content-based filtering approach is used to generate recommendation

We have designed a study to determine which bibliographic databases provide appropriate information for the field of artificial nutrition. Of the 149 databases consulted in the preliminary search, 15 were found to contain an appreciable number of titles related to our field. As a general result, we found that MEDLINE had the largest number of titles but other databases oriented toward more specific topics contained references that were unique to them. The results show that an exhaustive search for any topic concerning artificial nutrition must be done on MEDLINE, EMBASE and Current Contents (75\% productivity). These can be complemented with others according to their specialization in the subject to be treated. To obtain productivity over 75\%, from five to seven databases must be consulted, according to the item under study.},

@article{Lin2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: With the growing availability of full-text articles online, scientists and other consumers of the life sciences literature now have the ability to go beyond searching bibliographic records (title, abstract, metadata) to directly access full-text content. Motivated by this emerging trend, I posed the following question: is searching full text more effective than searching abstracts? This question is answered by comparing text retrieval algorithms on MEDLINE abstracts, full-text articles, and spans (paragraphs) within full-text articles using data from the TREC 2007 genomics track evaluation. Two retrieval models are examined: bm25 and the ranking algorithm implemented in the open-source Lucene search engine. RESULTS: Experiments show that treating an entire article as an indexing unit does not consistently yield higher effectiveness compared to abstract-only search. However, retrieval based on spans, or paragraphs-sized segments of full-text articles, consistently outperforms abstract-only search. Results suggest that highest overall effectiveness may be achieved by combining evidence from spans and full articles. CONCLUSION: Users searching full text are more likely to find relevant articles than searching only abstracts. This finding affirms the value of full text collections for text retrieval and provides a starting point for future work in exploring algorithms that take advantage of rapidly-growing digital archives. Experimental results also highlight the need to develop distributed text retrieval algorithms, since full-text articles are significantly longer than abstracts and may require the computational resources of multiple machines in a cluster. The MapReduce programming model provides a convenient framework for organizing such computations.},

@article{Scheers87,
abstract = {Academic cheating behavior by university students was surveyed using
the randomized response technique (RRT) and by conventional anonymous
questionnaire methods. RRT is a survey method that permits sensitive
information to be collected but that precludes associating the respondent
with a particular response to a survey item. The estimated proportions
of students who have engaged in cheating behaviors were, in general,
larger using RRT. Moreover, this result is consistent with earlier
findings for other sensitive behaviors. That underreporting is a
serious problem with anonymous questionnaires is supported by the
fact that the anonymous questionnaire estimates ranged from 39\% to
83\% below the RRT estimates. Furthermore, using a covariate modification
of RRT, there was a distinct inverse relation between students' estimated
grade-point average and the tendency to engage in cheating behavior.
While these results have direct implications for estimating cheating
behavior in higher education, more broadly, they raise serious concerns
about the use of anonymous questionnaires when survey topics are
sensitive.},

elements contained inside are too frightening to allow escape for
fear of the havoc that may result. Reluctance by academic members

often untenable situations we, as teachers, face when dealing with

English for Academic Purposes (EAP) staff face when dealing with
student plagiarism in the tertiary classroom. The perceptions of
all 11 teachers involved in teaching a first year EAP writing subject

policy on plagiarism. My research indicates that not only is an agreed
definition of plagiarism difficult to reach by members of staff teaching
the same subject, but plagiarism is a multi-layered phenomenon encompassing
a spectrum of human intention. Evaluating the spectrum can lead to
differences in the implementation of university plagiarism policy,
the result of which embodies issues of equity. The aim of the article
is to encourage policy-makers and academic staff to acknowledge the
concerns about implementation of plagiarism policy. Collaborative,
cross-disciplinary re-thinking of plagiarism is needed to reach workable

@phdthesis{Lancaster03,
abstract = {Student plagiarism, the process where a student uses the words or
ideas of another 

without acknowledgement and for academic credit, is believed to be
increasing. This 

is of concern since it devalues the awards that academic institutions
make and has 

recently been receiving increased media attention. This thesis presents
a process 

through which similarity within a corpus of documents can be found
and verified by a 

tutor to see if it represents plagiarism. Two key requirements for
the process are 

identified. The first is that it should be effective in that it correctly
identifies those 

documents that are the most similar. The second is that it should
be efficient; this 

means both computationally and in terms of tutor workload. 


A number of new ideas are introduced. The literature study reveals
that there is no 

consistency in the terms used to talk about plagiarism and a taxonomy
is proposed. It 

also finds inconsistencies in classifications of detection engines
for source code 

plagiarism. Alternative classifications that do not preclude free
text engines are 

presented. The main shortcoming of existing systems is that although
the engines 

might be effective the systems they support impact too greatly on
a tutor's time. 

Hence they are not efficient. 


A four-stage detection process consisting of collection, analysis,
verification and 

investigation is proposed. The greatest need for tool support would
be on the labour 

intensive verification and investigation stages. Here a tutor has
to examine two 

documents that have been flagged during the analysis stage. A visual
approach to 

demonstrate the similarity is recommended. A new graphic known as
a similarity 

visualisation is used that presents pixels whose intensity is generated
by the 

commonality of overlapping word fragments. The visualisations are
deployed by an 

interactive tool named VAST that allows quick verification and investigation
of 

suspect areas of the two submissions. 


The similarity visualisation is argued to provide the best representation
of similarity 

between two submissions and an ordering of pairs based on its properties
is argued to 

be effective. Generating visualisations for all possible pairs of
a large corpus is 

considered to not be currently computationally feasible. Instead,

abstract = {The cultural values of multilingual students are sometimes at variance
with Western academic practice, in matters such as plagiarism. In
accepting this, however, it is important to avoid stereotyping. Instead
we should respect and make use of the students' own traditions of
study. It is also time to acknowledge that ideas and language are
necessarily derivative, and to take account of this in our understanding
of plagiarism. Plagiarism itself can be discouraged by the use of
oral presentations, both as a means of improving language control,
and as a tool within the overall assessment process. In addition,
attention should be given to students' unfamiliarity with concepts
which are culturally conditioned.},

abstract = {The investigation of community structures in networks is an important issue in many domains and disciplines. This problem is relevant for social tasks (objective analysis of relationships on the web), biological inquiries (functional studies in metabolic and protein networks), or technological problems (optimization of large infrastructures). Several types of algorithms exist for revealing the community structure in networks, but a general and quantitative definition of community is not implemented in the algorithms, leading to an intrinsic difficulty in the interpretation of the results without any additional nontopological information. In this article we deal with this problem by showing how quantitative definitions of community are implemented in practice in the existing algorithms. In this way the algorithms for the identification of the community structure become fully self-contained. Furthermore, we propose a local algorithm to detect communities which outperforms the existing algorithms with respect to computational cost, keeping the same level of reliability. The algorithm is tested on artificial and real-world graphs. In particular, we show how the algorithm applies to a network of scientific collaborations, which, for its size, cannot be attacked with the usual methods. This type of local algorithm could open the way to applications to large-scale technological and biological systems.},

little overlap was found between the search engines. To complete

The system consists of different subsystems and services. One subsystem is the Training System. It is based on three models: the Tutoring Process Model, the Case Knowledge Model and the Medical Knowledge Model. They describe the tutoring process as a series of nodes and steps, depict the structure of the medical cases, and provide the medical knowledge respectively. Case knowledge and medical knowledge form the expert knowledge of the medical domain. Together with the tutoring process, they build the basis for automatic intelligent tutoring. After giving a deeper insight into the system architecture and the training case structure, an informal evaluation shows a first feedback of the learners.},

abstract = {Objective To understand belief in a specific scientific claim by studying
the pattern of citations among papers stating it.Design A complete
citation network was constructed from all PubMed indexed English
literature papers addressing the belief that $\beta$ amyloid, a protein
accumulated in the brain in Alzheimer’s disease, is produced by and
injures skeletal muscle of patients with inclusion body myositis.
Social network theory and graph theory were used to analyse this
network.Main outcome measures Citation bias, amplification, and invention,
and their effects on determining authority.Results The network contained
242 papers and 675 citations addressing the belief, with 220 553
citation paths supporting it. Unfounded authority was established
by citation bias against papers that refuted or weakened the belief;
amplification, the marked expansion of the belief system by papers
presenting no data addressing it; and forms of invention such as
the conversion of hypothesis into fact through citation alone. Extension
of this network into text within grants funded by the National Institutes
of Health and obtained through the Freedom of Information Act showed
the same phenomena present and sometimes used to justify requests
for funding.Conclusion Citation is both an impartial scholarly method
and a powerful form of social communication. Through distortions
in its social use that include bias, amplification, and invention,
citation can be used to generate information cascades resulting in
unfounded authority of claims. Construction and analysis of a claim
specific citation network may clarify the nature of a published belief
system and expose distorted methods of social citation.},

abstract = {Most previous work on authorship attribution has focused on the case
in which we need to attribute an anonymous document to one of a small
set of candidate authors. In this paper, we consider authorship attribution
as found in the wild: the set of known candidates is extremely large
(possibly many thousands) and might not even include the actual author.
Moreover, the known texts and the anonymous texts might be of limited
length. We show that even in these difficult cases, we can use similarity-based
methods along with multiple randomized feature sets to achieve high
precision. Moreover, we show the precise relationship between attribution
precision and four parameters: the size of the candidate set, the
quantity of known-text by the candidates, the length of the anonymous
text and a certain robustness score associated with a attribution.},

abstract = {Recent literature has demonstrated the applicability of genetic programming to induction of decision trees for modelling toxicity endpoints. Compared with other decision tree induction techniques that are based upon recursive partitioning employing greedy searches to choose the best splitting attribute and value at each node that will necessarily miss regions of the search space, the genetic programming based approach can overcome the problem. However, the method still requires the discretization of the often continuous-valued toxicity endpoints prior to the tree induction. A novel extension of this method, YAdapt, is introduced in this work which models the original continuous endpoint by adaptively finding suitable ranges to describe the endpoints during the tree induction process, removing the need for discretization prior to tree induction and allowing the ordinal nature of the endpoint to be taken into account in the models built.},

systems. The three main classes that have been investigated are the
exact-match, vector space and probabilistic models. The retrieval
effectiveness of strategies based on these models has been evaluated
experimentally, but there has been little in the way of comparison
in terms of their formal properties. In this paper we introduce a
recent form of the probabilistic model based on inference networks,
and show how the vector space and exact-match can be described in
this framework. Differences between these models can be explained
as differences in the estimation of probabilities, both in the initial
search and during relevance feedback.},

abstract = {Some methods for rank correlation in evaluation are examined and their
relative ad-

vantages and disadvantages are discussed. In particular, it is suggested
that di®erent test

statistics should be used for providing additional information about
the experiments other

that the one provided by statistical signi ̄cance testing. Kendall's
¿ is often used for testing

rank correlation, yet it is little appropriate if the objective of
the test is di®erent from what

¿ was designed for. In particular, attention should be paid to the
null hypothesis. Other

measures for rank correlation are described. If one test statistic
suggests to reject a hypoth-

esis, other test statistics should be used to support or to revise
the decision. The paper

then focuses on rank correlation between webpage lists ordered by
PageRank for applying

the general re°ections on these test statistics. An interpretation
of PageRank behaviour is

provided on the basis of the discussion of the test statistics for
rank correlation.},

abstract = {Plagiarism is a serious problem in higher education and generally
acknowledged to be 

on the increase (McCabe, 2005). Text analysis tools have the potential
to be applied to 

work submitted by students and assist the educator in the detection
of plagiarised text. 

It is difficult to develop and evaluate such systems without examples
of such 

documents. There is therefore the need for resources that contain
examples of 

plagiarised text submitted by students. However, gathering examples
of such texts 

presents a unique set of challenges for corpus construction. 


This paper discusses current work towards the creation of a corpus
of documents 

submitted for assessment in higher education that contain examples
of simulated 

plagiarism. The corpus is designed to represent the types of plagiarism
that are found 

within higher education as closely as possible. We describe the process
of corpus 

creation and some features of the resulting resource. It is hoped
that this resource will 

become useful for research into the problem of plagiarism detection.},

abstract = {Internet plagiarism and paper industrypsilas development lead to the
extension of plagiarism phenomenon. However, Chinese anti-plagiarism
is still in the initial stages of development.Moreover, plagiarism
activities involve directly copying and semantic plagiarizing, so
the definition of plagiarism cannot be unified. From 2006 to 2008,
based on two patents, we implement an anti-plagiarism system named
ROST AntiP which covers 18.8 billion Web pages and 4.9 million literatures,
presents flexible match technology based on attribute value strings,
can flexibly define plagiarism rule, and can implement fuzzy detection.
This system has been practically using in several editorial office
and universities. According to the practical collecting data, we
find the PlagTrendHot phenomenon and the plagiarism-first-page phenomenon,
thereby we improve the macroscopical algorithm to solve detecting
speed problem. Besides, we accurately estimate the context bound
errors involved in fuzzy matching, and preliminarily achieve the
practice implementation goal.},

abstract = {Research in automatic text plagiarism detection focuses on algorithms
that compare suspicious documents against a collection of reference
documents. Recent approaches perform well in identifying copied or
modified foreign sections, but they assume a closed world where a
reference collection is given. This article investigates the question
whether plagiarism can be detected by a computer program if no reference
can be provided, e.g., if the foreign sections stem from a book that
is not available in digital form. We call this problem class intrinsic
plagiarism analysis; it is closely related to the problem of authorship
verification. Our contributions are threefold. (1) We organize the
algorithmic building blocks for intrinsic plagiarism analysis and
authorship verification and survey the state of the art. (2) We show
how the meta learning approach of Koppel and Schler, termed unmasking
, can be employed to post-process unreliable stylometric analysis
results. (3) We operationalize and evaluate an analysis chain that
combines document chunking, style model computation, one-class classification,
and meta learning.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose a novel measure based on the earth mover's
distance (EMD) to evaluate document similarity by allowing many-to-many
matching between subtopics. First, each document is decomposed into
a set of subtopics, and then the EMD is employed to evaluate the
similarity between two sets of subtopics for two documents by solving
the transportation problem. The proposed measure is an improvement
of the previous OM-based measure, which allows only one-to-one matching
between subtopics. Experiments have been performed on the TDT3 dataset
to evaluate existing similarity measures and the results show that
the EMD-based measure outperforms the optimal matching (OM) based
measure and all other measures. In addition to the TextTiling algorithm,
the sentence clustering algorithm is adopted for document decomposition,
and the experimental results show that the proposed EMD-based measure
does not rely on the document decomposition algorithm and thus it
is more robust than the OM-based measure.},

research. Relevance judgments, which are necessary

for system evaluation, are expensive; the cost of obtaining

them prohibits in-house evaluation of retrieval systems

on new corpora or new topics. We present an algorithm

for cheaply constructing sets of relevance judgments. Our

method intelligently selects documents to be judged and decides

when to stop in such a way that with very little work

there can be a high degree of condence in the result of the

evaluation. We demonstrate the algorithm's eectiveness by

showing that it produces small sets of relevance judgments

that reliably discriminate between two systems. The algorithm

can be used to incrementally design retrieval systems

by simultaneously comparing sets of systems. The number

of additional judgments needed after each incremental design

change decreases at a rate reciprocal to the number

of systems being compared. To demonstrate the eectiveness

of our method, we evaluate TREC ad hoc submissions,

showing that with 95\% fewer relevance judgments we can

reach a Kendall's tau rank correlation of at least 0.9.},

abstract = {The existence of huge volumes of documents written in multiple languages
on Internet leads to investigate novel algorithmic approaches to
deal with information of this kind. However, most crosslingual natural
language processing (NLP) tasks consider a decoupled approach in
which monolingual NLP techniques are applied along with an independent
translation process. This two-step approach is too sensitive to translation
errors, and in general to the accumulative effect of errors. To solve
this problem, we propose to use a direct probabilistic crosslingual
NLP system which integrates both steps, translation and the specific
NLP task, into a single one. In order to perform this integrated
approach to crosslingual tasks, we propose to use the statistical
IBM 1 word alignment model (M1). The M1 model may show a non-monotonic
behaviour when aligning words from a sentence in a source language
to words from another sentence in a different, target language. This
is the case of languages with different word order. In English, for
instance, adjectives appear before nouns, whereas in Spanish it is
exactly the opposite. The successful experimental results reported
in three different tasks - text classification, information retrieval
and plagiarism analysis - highlight the benefits of the statistical
integrated approach proposed in this work.},

why do we need adaptive hypermedia (AH), where can it be useful,

@article{Lee06,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Topic detection is a task that automatically identifies
topics (e.g., "biochemistry" and "protein structure") in scientific
articles based on information content. Topic detection will benefit
many other natural language processing tasks including information
retrieval, text summarization and question answering; and is a necessary
step towards the building of an information system that provides
an efficient way for biologists to seek information from an ocean
of literature.


RESULTS: We have explored the methods of Topic Spotting, a task of
text categorization that applies the supervised machine-learning
technique na\"{\i}ve Bayes to assign automatically a document into one
or more predefined topics; and Topic Clustering, which apply unsupervised
hierarchical clustering algorithms to aggregate documents into clusters
such that each cluster represents a topic. We have applied our methods
to detect topics of more than fifteen thousand of articles that represent
over sixteen thousand entries in the Online Mendelian Inheritance
in Man (OMIM) database. We have explored bag of words as the features.
Additionally, we have explored semantic features; namely, the Medical
Subject Headings (MeSH) that are assigned to the MEDLINE records,
and the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) semantic types that
correspond to the MeSH terms, in addition to bag of words, to facilitate
the tasks of topic detection. Our results indicate that incorporating
the MeSH terms and the UMLS semantic types as additional features
enhances the performance of topic detection and the na\"{\i}ve Bayes has
the highest accuracy, 66.4\%, for predicting the topic of an OMIM
article as one of the total twenty-five topics.


CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the supervised topic spotting
methods outperformed the unsupervised topic clustering; on the other
hand, the unsupervised topic clustering methods have the advantages
of being robust and applicable in real world settings.},

an effective system for the

The difference between human and

abstract = {WordNet, an electronic lexical database, is considered to be the most
important resource available to researchers in computational linguistics,
text analysis, and many related areas. Its design is inspired by
current psycholinguistic and computational theories of human lexical
memory. English nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are organized
into synonym sets, each representing one underlying lexicalized concept.
Different relations link the synonym sets. <P>The purpose of this
volume is twofold. First, it discusses the design of WordNet and
the theoretical motivations behind it. Second, it provides a survey
of representative applications, including word sense identification,
information retrieval, selectional preferences of verbs, and lexical
chains. <P>Contributors: Reem Al-Halimi, Robert C. Berwick, J. F.

abstract = {When automatic plagiarism detection is carried out considering a reference
corpus, a suspicious text is compared to a set of original documents
in order to relate the plagiarised text fragments to their potential
source. One of the biggest difficulties in this task is to locate
plagiarised fragments that have been modified (by rewording, insertion
or deletion, for example) from the source text. The definition of
proper text chunks as comparison units of the suspicious and original
texts is crucial for the success of this kind of applications. Our
experiments with the METER corpus show that the best results are
obtained when considering low level word n-grams comparisons (n?=?\{2,3\}).},

scholarly databases. This article summarises the debate and then
critically examines Google Scholar through a number of practical

abstract = {Motivated by several applications, we introduce various distance measures
between “top k lists.” Some of these distance measures are metrics,
while others are not. For each of these latter distance measures,
we show that they are “almost” a metric in the following two seemingly
unrelated aspects:

(i) they satisfy a relaxed version of the polygonal (hence, triangle)
inequality, and

(ii) there is a metric with positive constant multiples that bound
our measure above and below. 

This is not a coincidence—we show that these two notions of almost
being a metric are same. Based on the second notion, we define two
distance measures to be equivalent if they are bounded above and
below by constant multiples of each other. We thereby identify a
large and robust equivalence class of distance measures.

Besides the applications to the task of identifying good notions of
(dis-)similarity between two top k lists, our results imply polynomial-time
constant-factor approximation algorithms for the rank aggregation
problem with respect to a large class of distance measures.},

used in numerous applications in tests for trend and for independence.
However, little has been said about how to define rank correlation
when the data are incomplete. The practice has often been to ignore
missing observations and to define rank correlation for the smaller
complete record. We propose a new class of measures of rank correlation
which are based on a notion of distance between incomplete rankings.
There is the potential for a significant increase in efficiency over
the approach which ignores missing observations as demonstrated by
a specific case.},

be further intensified by two current trends: (i) the widespread
use of digital indexing, retrieval, and navigation resources and
(ii) the emergence within many scientific disciplines of interoperable
ontologies. Accelerated and enhanced by reading tools that take advantage

developed within the AXMEDIS project. The algorithm leverages the
plagiarist behaviour, which is modeled as a combination of 3 basical
actions: insertion, deletion, substitution. We recognize that this
behaviour may occur at various level of the document structure: the
plagiarist may insert, delete or substitute a word, period or a paragraph.
The procedure consists in two main steps: document structure extraction
and plagiarism function calculation. We propose a recursive plagiarism
evaluation function to be evaluated at each level of the document
structure which is based on the Levenshtein edit distance. We also
propose a method that will eliminate unnecessary chunks comparison,
avoiding similarity calculation of chunks which do not share enough
4-grams. We describe the similarity algorithm and discuss some implementation

abstract = {Self-plagiarism requires clear definition within an environment that
places integrity at the heart of the research enterprise. This paper
explores the whole notion of self-plagiarism by academics and distinguishes
between appropriate and inappropriate textual re-use in academic
publications, while considering research on other forms of plagiarism
such as student plagiarism. Based on the practical experience of
the authors in identifying academics’ self-plagiarism using both
electronic detection and manual analysis, a simple model is proposed
for identifying self-plagiarism by academics.},

@article{Errami09,
abstract = {In the scientific research community, plagiarism and covert multiple
publications of the same data are considered unacceptable because
they undermine the public confidence in the scientific integrity.
Yet, little has been done to help authors and editors to identify
highly similar citations, which sometimes may represent cases of
unethical duplication. For this reason, we have made available D\'{e}j\`{a}
vu, a publicly available database of highly similar Medline citations
identified by the text similarity search engine eTBLAST. Following
manual verification, highly similar citation pairs are classified
into various categories ranging from duplicates with different authors
to sanctioned duplicates. D\'{e}j\`{a} vu records also contain user-provided
commentary and supporting information to substantiate each document's
categorization. D\'{e}j\`{a} vu and eTBLAST are available to authors, editors,
reviewers, ethicists and sociologists to study, intercept, annotate
and deter questionable publication practices. These tools are part
of a sustained effort to enhance the quality of Medline as ‘the’
biomedical corpus. The D\'{e}j\`{a} vu database is freely accessible at http:spore.swmed.edudejavu.
The tool eTBLAST is also freely available at http:etblast.org.},

@patent{Gipp2010,
abstract = {(DE) Die Erfindung betrifft ein computer-implementiertes Verfahren
zum Ermitteln einer \"{A}hnlichkeit zwischen zumindest einem Eingabedokument
und einer Anzahl von Dokumenten. Es werden erste Dokumente und zweite
Dokumente ermittelt, welche direkt oder indirekt von dem Eingabedokument
referenziert werden oder das Eingabedokument referenzieren. F\"{u}r jedes
ermittelte Dokument wird mindestens ein vorl\"{a}ufiger \"{A}hnlichkeitswert
berechnet. Ist zu einem Dokument mehr als ein vorl\"{a}ufiger \"{A}hnlichkeitswert
berechnet worden, wird aus den vorl\"{a}ufigen Ahnlichkeitswerten ein
endg\"{u}ltiger \"{A}hnlichkeitswert berechnet. Das Verfahren kann wiederum
auf die ermittelten ersten Dokumente und zweiten Dokumente angewandt
werden, um weitere \"{a}hnliche Dokumente zu dem Eingabedokument zu ermitteln
und deren \"{A}hnlichkeitswerte zu dem Eingabedokument zu berechnen.

(EN) The invention relates to a computer-implemented method for detecting
a similarity between at least one input document and a plurality
of documents. First documents and second documents are detected which
are directly or indirectly cited by the input document or which directly
or indirectly cite the input document. At least one preliminary similarity
value is calculated for every detected document. If more than one
preliminary similarity value has been calculated for a document,
a final similarity value is calculated from the preliminary similarity
values. The method can then be applied to the detected first documents
and second documents to detect further documents that are similar
to the input document and to calculate their similarity values to
the input document.

pour chaque document d\'{e}termin\'{e}. Si plus d'une valeur de similarit\'{e}
provisoire a \'{e}t\'{e} calcul\'{e}e pour un document, une valeur de similarit\'{e}
d\'{e}finitive est calcul\'{e}e \`{a} partir des valeurs de similarit\'{e} provisoire.
Ce proc\'{e}d\'{e} peut encore \^{e}tre appliqu\'{e} aux premiers et aux deuxi\`{e}mes

abstract = {The earth moverpsilas distance (EMD) is an important perceptually
meaningful metric for comparing histograms, but it suffers from high
(O(N3 logN)) computational complexity. We present a novel linear
time algorithm for approximating the EMD for low dimensional histograms
using the sum of absolute values of the weighted wavelet coefficients
of the difference histogram. EMD computation is a special case of
the Kantorovich-Rubinstein transshipment problem, and we exploit
the Holder continuity constraint in its dual form to convert it into
a simple optimization problem with an explicit solution in the wavelet
domain. We prove that the resulting wavelet EMD metric is equivalent
to EMD, i.e. the ratio of the two is bounded. We also provide estimates
for the bounds. The weighted wavelet transform can be computed in
time linear in the number of histogram bins, while the comparison
is about as fast as for normal Euclidean distance or chi2 statistic.
We experimentally show that wavelet EMD is a good approximation to
EMD, has similar performance, but requires much less computation.},

abstract = {The role demographic, personality, and situational factors play in
the ethical decision making process has received a significant amount
of attention (Ford and Richardson, 1994). However, the empirical
research on students' decisions to engage in collegiate cheating
has not been included in this literature. This paper reviews the
last 25 years of empirical research on collegiate cheating. The individualsituational
factor typology from Ford and Richardson's review (1994) is used
to compare the two literatures. In addition, issues pertaining to
the quantification of academic dishonesty, the perception that cheating
is increasing, and methodological considerations are addressed in
this review.},

abstract = {Easy access to the Web has led to increased potential for students
cheating on assignments by plagiarising others' work. By the same
token, Web-based tools offer the potential for instructors to check
submitted assignments for signs of plagiarism. Overlap-detection
tools are easy to use and accurate in plagiarism detection, so they
can be an excellent deterrent to plagiarism. Documents can overlap
for other reasons, too: Old documents are superseded, and authors
summarize previous work identically in several papers. Overlap-detection
tools can pinpoint interconnections in a corpus of documents and
could be used in search engines.We describe a web-accessible text
registry based on signature extraction. We extract a small but diagnostic
signature from each registered text for permanent storage and comparison
against other stored signatures. This comparison allows us to estimate
the amount of overlap between pairs of documents, although the total
time required is linear in the total size of the documents. We compare
our algorithm with several alternatives and present both efficiency
and accuracy results.},

abstract = {Forming test collection relevance judgments from the pooled

output of multiple retrieval systems has become the standard

process for creating resources such as the TREC, CLEF, and

NTCIR test collections. This paper presents a series of

experiments examining three different ways of building test

collections where no system pooling is used. First, a collection

formation technique combining manual feedback and multiple

systems is adapted to work with a single retrieval system. Second,

an existing method based on pooling the output of multiple

manual searches is re-examined: testing a wider range of

searchers and retrieval systems than has been examined before.

Third, a new approach is explored where the ranked output of a

single automatic search on a single retrieval system is assessed for

relevance: no pooling whatsoever. Using established techniques

for evaluating the quality of relevance judgments, in all three

cases, test collections are formed that are as good as TREC.},

abstract = {Research suggests that the majority of U.S. undergraduate students
have engaged in some form of misconduct while completing their academic
work, despite knowing that such behaviour is ethically or morally
wrong. U.S.-based studies have also identified myriad personal and
institutional factors associated with academic misconduct. Implicit
in some of these factors are several institutional strategies that
may be implemented to support academic integrity: revisiting the
values and goals of higher education, recommitting to quality in
teaching and assessment practice, establishing effective policies
and invigilation practices, providing educational opportunities and
support for all members of the university community, and using (modified)
academic honour codes. There is a dearth of similar research in Canada
despite growing recognition that academic misconduct is a problem
on Canadian campuses. This paper suggests that Canadian higher education
can learn much from the U.S. experience and calls for both a recommitment
to academic integrity and research on academic misconduct in Canadian
higher education institutions.},

abstract = {Abstract. Empirical evaluations are needed to determine which users
are helped or hindered by user-adapted interaction in user modeling
systems. A review of past UMUAI articles reveals insuf�cient empirical
evaluations, but an encouraging upward trend. Rules of thumb for
experimental design, useful tests for covariates, and common threats
to experimental validity are presented. Reporting standards including
effect size and power are proposed. Key words: empirical evaluation,
experimental design, covariant variables, e�ect size, treat-ment
magnitude, power, sensitivity. 1. What Is Empirical Evaluation? Empirical
evaluation refers to the appraisal of a theory by observation in
experiments. The key to good empirical evaluation is the proper design
and execution of the experiments so that the particular factors to
be tested can be easily separated from other confounding factors.
For example, one may want to test whether a software system with
a user model works better than the same system without a user model,
test the effect of different levels of user modeling or different
user model parameter settings, or test different user interfaces.

abstract = {The aim of this study is to investigate the relationships between citations and the scientific argumentation found abstracts. We design a related article search task and observe how the argumentation can affect the search results. We extracted citation lists from a set of 3200 full-text papers originating from a narrow domain. In parallel, we recovered the corresponding MEDLINE records for analysis of the argumentative moves. Our argumentative model is founded on four classes: PURPOSE, METHODS, RESULTS and CONCLUSION. A Bayesian classifier trained on explicitly structured MEDLINE abstracts generates these argumentative categories. The categories are used to generate four different argumentative indexes. A fifth index contains the complete abstract, together with the title and the list of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. To appraise the relationship of the moves to the citations, the citation lists were used as the criteria for determining relatedness of articles, establishing a benchmark; it means that two articles are considered as "related" if they share a significant set of co-citations. Our results show that the average precision of queries with the PURPOSE and CONCLUSION features is the highest, while the precision of the RESULTS and METHODS features was relatively low. A linear weighting combination of the moves is proposed, which significantly improves retrieval of related articles.},

@incollection{Abouelhoda10,
abstract = {Sequence analysis is a major area in bioinformatics encompassing the
methods and techniques for studying the biological sequences, DNA,
RNA, and proteins, on the linear structure level. The focus of this
area is generally on the identification of intra– and inter–molecular
similarities. Identifying intra–molecular similarities boils down
to detecting repeated segments within a given sequence, while identifying
inter–molecular similarities amounts to spotting common segments
among two or multiple sequences. From a data mining point of view,
sequence analysis is nothing but string- or pattern mining specific
to biological strings. For a long time, this point of view, however,
has not been explicitly embraced neither in the data mining nor in
the sequence analysis text books, which may be attributed to the
co-evolution of the two apparently independent fields. In other words,
although the word data-mining is almost missing in the sequence analysis
literature, its basic concepts have been implicitly applied. Interestingly,
recent research in biological sequence analysis introduced efficient
solutions to many problems in data mining, such as querying and analyzing
time series [49,53], extracting information from web pages [20],
fighting spam mails [50], detecting plagiarism [22], and spotting
duplications in software systems [14].},

abstract = {Dishonest behavior at the college level, particularly by business
students, is an ethical issue of concern to the academic and business
communities. Corporate scandals and federal legislation have brought
additional attention to the ethical behavior of business leaders
and the role of higher education in training the leaders of tomorrow.
If students exhibit unethical and dishonest behavior in college,
they may carry those attitudes and behaviors into the workplace.
This paper looks at business students' attitudes and behaviors in
regard to academic dishonesty. The extent and causes of academic
dishonesty are reviewed, as well as the varying degree and frequency
of dishonest acts and related penalties. The results of this study,
which are based on a survey that was completed by 1,255 business
students, reflect future business leaders' attitudes toward academic
dishonesty -- which acts are most dishonest and how those behaviors
should be penalized -- and the extent to which they engage },

abstract = {Digital plagiarism is a problem for educators all over the world.
There are many software tools on the market for uncovering digital
plagiarism. Most of them can work only with text submissions. In
this paper, we present a new architecture for a plagiarism detection
tool that can work with many different kinds of digital submissions,
from plain or formatted texts to audio podcasts. The open architecture
is based on converting the digital submission into text form for
processing by a plagiarism detection algorithm. To process non-text
submissions, the system is extended with the appropriate converter.
Such an open architecture makes the anti-plagiarism toolbox universal
and easily adaptable for processing virtually any kind of digital
submissions. This paper describes a software prototype based on the
proposed architecture and presents the results of its implementation
on a large archive of student papers.},

abstract = {Digital documents are vulnerable to being copied. Most existing copy
detection prototypes employ an exhaustive sentence-based comparison
method in comparing a potential plagiarized document against a repository
of legal or original documents to identify plagiarism activities.
This approach is not scalable due to the potentially large number
of original documents and the large number of sentences in each document.
Furthermore, the security level of existing mechanisms is quite weak;
a plagiarized document could simply by-pass the detection mechanisms
by performing a minor modification on each sentence. In this paper,
we propose a copy detection mechanism that will eliminate unnecessary
comparisons. This is based on the observation that comparisons between
two documents addressing different subjects are not necessary. We
describe the design and implementation of our experimental prototype
called CHECK. The results of some exploratory experiments will be
illustrated and the security level of our mechanism will be discussed.},

We treatk not as a constant but as a fraction ofm (not necessarily

an improvement in that it is practical and uses0(m) space compared
with0(n) or0(m 2). We define three problems motivated by molecular
biology and describe efficient algorithms based on our techniques:
(1) approximate substring matching, (2) approximate-overlap detection,

abstract = {The reasons for distortions from optimal $\alpha$-helical geometry are widely unknown, but their influences on structural changes of proteins are significant. Hence, their prediction is a crucial problem in structural bioinformatics. For the particular case of kink prediction, we generated a data set of 132 membrane proteins containing 1014 manually labeled helices and examined the environment of kinks. Our sequence analysis confirms the great relevance of proline and reveals disproportionately high occurrences of glycine and serine at kink positions. The structural analysis shows significantly different solvent accessible surface area mean values for kinked and nonkinked helices. More important, we used this data set to validate string kernels for support vector machines as a new kink prediction method. Applying the new predictor, about 80\% of all helices could be correctly predicted as kinked or nonkinked even when focusing on small helical fragments. The results exceed recently reported accuracies of alternative approaches and are a consequence of both the method and the data set.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: To date, many of the methods for information extraction of biological information from scientific articles are restricted to the abstract of the article. However, full text articles in electronic version, which offer larger sources of data, are currently available. Several questions arise as to whether the effort of scanning full text articles is worthy, or whether the information that can be extracted from the different sections of an article can be relevant. RESULTS: In this work we addressed those questions showing that the keyword content of the different sections of a standard scientific article (abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion) is very heterogeneous. CONCLUSIONS: Although the abstract contains the best ratio of keywords per total of words, other sections of the article may be a better source of biologically relevant data.},

abstract = {In this article, we present a macroscopic analytical model of collaboration in a group of reactive robots. The model consists of a series of coupled differential equations that describe the dynamics of group behavior. After presenting the general model, we analyze in detail a case study of collaboration, the stick-pulling experiment, studied experimentally and in simulation by Ijspeert et al. [Autonomous Robots, 11, 149-171]. The robots' task is to pull sticks out of their holes, and it can be successfully achieved only through the collaboration of two robots. There is no explicit communication or coordination between the robots. Unlike microscopic simulations (sensor-based or using a probabilistic numerical model), in which computational time scales with the robot group size, the macroscopic model is computationally efficient, because its solutions are independent of robot group size. Analysis reproduces several qualitative conclusions of Ijspeert et al.: namely, the different dynamical regimes for different values of the ratio of robots to sticks, the existence of optimal control parameters that maximize system performance as a function of group size, and the transition from superlinear to sublinear performance as the number of robots is increased.},

abstract = {Motivation: Clustering MEDLINE documents is usually conducted by the
vector space model, which computes the content similarity between
two documents by basically using the inner-product of their word
vectors. Recently the semantic information of MeSH (Medical Subject
Headings) thesaurus is being applied to clustering MEDLINE documents
by mapping documents into MeSH concept vectors to be clustered. However,
current approaches of using MeSH thesaurus have two serious limitations:
First, important semantic information may be lost when generating
MeSH concept vectors, and second, the content information of the
original text has been discarded.Methods: Our new strategy includes
three key points. First, we develop a sound method for measuring
the semantic similarity between two documents over the MeSH thesaurus.
Second, we combine both the semantic and content similarities to
generate the integrated similarity matrix between documents. Third,
we apply a spectral approach to clustering documents over the integrated
similarity matrix.Results: Using various 100 datasets of MEDLINE
records, we conduct extensive experiments with changing alternative
measures and parameters. Experimental results show that integrating
the semantic and content similarities outperforms the case of using
only one of the two similarities, being statistically significant.
We further find the best parameter setting which is consistent over
all experimental conditions conducted. We finally show a typical
example of resultant clusters, confirming the effectiveness of our
strategy in improving MEDLINE document clustering.},

abstract = {Plagiarism detection engines are programs that compare documents with
possible sources in order to identify similarity and so discover
student submissions that might be plagiarised. They are currently
classified as either attribute counting systems or structure metric

free text detection engines as this is where most current research
is focused. 

This paper proposes a new and alternative set of classifications based
primarily around the types of the metrics the engines use. Current
detection engines are classified using the new groupings. These new

abstract = {Automatic plagiarism detection considering a reference corpus compares
a suspicious text to a set of original documents in order to relate
the plagiarised fragments to their potential source. Publications
on this task often assume that the search space (the set of reference
documents) is a narrow set where any search strategy will produce
a good output in a short time. However, this is not always true.
Reference corpora are often composed of a big set of original documents
where a simple exhaustive search strategy becomes practically impossible.
Before carrying out an exhaustive search, it is necessary to reduce
the search space, represented by the documents in the reference corpus,
as much as possible. Our experiments with the METER corpus show that
a previous search space reduction stage, based on the Kullback-Leibler
symmetric distance, reduces the search process time dramatically.
Additionally, it improves the Precision and Recall obtained by a
search strategy based on the exhaustive comparison of word n-grams.},

abstract = {Plagiarism in texts is issues of increasing concern to the academic
community. Now most common text plagiarism occurs by making a variety
of minor alterations that include the insertion, deletion, or substitution
of words. Such simple changes, however, require excessive string
comparisons. In this paper, we present a hybrid plagiarism detection
method. We investigate the use of a diagonal line, which is derived
from Levenshtein distance, and simplified Smith-Waterman algorithm
that is a classical tool in the identification and quantification
of local similarities in biological sequences, with a view to the
application in the plagiarism detection. Our approach avoids globally
involved string comparisons and considers psychological factors,
which can yield significant speed-up by experiment results. Based
on the results, we indicate the practicality of such improvement
using Levenshtein distance and Smith-Waterman algorithm and to illustrate
the efficiency gains. In the future, it would be interesting to explore
appropriate heuristics in the area of text comparison.},

abstract = {Machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms have in the past years developed to become a working horse in brain imaging and the computational neurosciences, as they are instrumental for mining vast amounts of neural data of ever increasing measurement precision and detecting minuscule signals from an overwhelming noise floor. They provide the means to decode and characterize task relevant brain states and to distinguish them from non-informative brain signals. While undoubtedly this machinery has helped to gain novel biological insights, it also holds the danger of potential unintentional abuse. Ideally machine learning techniques should be usable for any non-expert, however, unfortunately they are typically not. Overfitting and other pitfalls may occur and lead to spurious and nonsensical interpretation. The goal of this review is therefore to provide an accessible and clear introduction to the strengths and also the inherent dangers of machine learning usage in the neurosciences.},

@article{Merton68,
abstract = {This account of the Matthew effect is another small exercise in the
psychosociological analysis of the workings of science as a social
institution. The initial problem is transformed by a shift in theoretical
perspective. As originally identified, the Matthew effect was construed
in terms of enhancement of the position of already eminent scientists
who are given disproportionate credit in cases of collaboration or
of independent multiple discoveries. Its significance was thus confined
to its implications for the reward system of science. By shifting
the angle of vision, we note other possible kinds of consequences,
this time for the communication system of science. The Matthew effect
may serve to heighten the visibility of contributions to science
by scientists of acknowledged standing and to reduce the visibility
of contributions by authors who are less well known. We examine the
psychosocial conditions and mechanisms underlying this effect and
find a correlation between the redundancy function of multiple discoveries
and the focalizing function of eminent men of science—a function
which is reinforced by the great value these men place upon finding
basic problems and by their self-assurance. This self-assurance,
which is partly inherent, partly the result of experiences and associations
in creative scientific environments, and partly a result of later
social validation of their position, encourages them to search out
risky but important problems and to highlight the results of their
inquiry. A macrosocial version of the Matthew principle is apparently
involved in those processes of social selection that currently lead
to the concentration of scientific resources and talent (50).},

abstract = {Abstract:


Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to identify the most popular
techniques used to rank a web page highly in Google.


Designmethodologyapproach – The paper presents the results of a study
into 50 highly optimized web pages that were created as part of a
Search Engine Optimization competition. The study focuses on the
most popular techniques that were used to rank highest in this competition,
and includes an analysis on the use of PageRank, number of pages,
number of in-links, domain age and the use of third party sites such
as directories and social bookmarking sites. A separate study was
made into 50 non-optimized web pages for comparison.


Findings – The paper provides insight into the techniques that successful
Search Engine Optimizers use to ensure a page ranks highly in Google.
Recognizes the importance of PageRank and links as well as directories
and social bookmarking sites.


Research limitationsimplications – Only the top 50 web sites for a
specific query were analyzed. Analysing more web sites and comparing
with similar studies in different competition would provide more
concrete results.


Practical implications – The paper offers a revealing insight into
the techniques used by industry experts to rank highly in Google,
and the success or otherwise of those techniques.


Originalityvalue – This paper fulfils an identified need for web sites
and e-commerce sites keen to attract a wider web audience.},

research domains is articles published in journals. The digital era
as a whole has had many impacts on the activities of article creation
and use. Of particular significance is the availability of the Internet
as a distribution mechanism. This is bringing about significant changes
in the economics of journal publishing. The dimensions of those changes
are examined within the context provided by models of the roles of
journals in the mid-to-late twentieth and the early twenty-first
centuries. Several early indicators of fundamental changes in the
process and product of the journal are considered. Tensions between
for-profit and open-access publishing are identified. The new potentials
for community-based endeavor create the likelihood of upheaval in
what has been a highly profitable industry sector.},

@article{Needleman70,
abstract = {A computer adaptable method for finding similarities in the amino
acid sequences of two proteins has been developed. From these findings
it is possible to determine whether significant homology exists between
the proteins. This information is used to trace their possible evolutionary
development. The maximum match is a number dependent upon the similarity
of the sequences. One of its definitions is the largest number of
amino acids of one protein that can be matched with those of a second
protein allowing for all possible interruptions in either of the
sequences. While the interruptions give rise to a very large number
of comparisons, the method efficiently excludes from consideration
those comparisons that cannot contribute to the maximum match. Comparisons
are made from the smallest unit of significance, a pair of amino
acids, one from each protein. All possible pairs are represented
by a two-dimensional array, and all possible comparisons are represented
by pathways through the array. For this maximum match only certain
of the possible pathways must be evaluated. A numerical value, one
in this case, is assigned to every cell in the array representing
like amino acids. The maximum match is the largest number that would
result from summing the cell values of every pathway.},

@article{Potthast10,
abstract = {Cross-language plagiarism detection deals with the automatic identification
and extraction of plagiarism in a multilingual setting. In this setting,
a suspicious document is given, and the task is to retrieve all sections
from the document that originate from a large, multilingual document
collection. Our contributions in this field are as follows: (1) a
comprehensive retrieval process for cross-language plagiarism detection
is introduced, highlighting the differences to monolingual plagiarism
detection, (2) state-of-the-art solutions for two important subtasks
are reviewed, (3) retrieval models for the assessment of cross-language
similarity are surveyed, and, (4) the three models CL-CNG, CL-ESA
and CL-ASA are compared. Our evaluation is of realistic scale: it
relies on 120,000 test documents which are selected from the corpora
JRC-Acquis and Wikipedia, so that for each test document highly similar
documents are available in all of the six languages English, German,
Spanish, French, Dutch, and Polish. The models are employed in a
series of ranking tasks, and more than 100 million similarities are
computed with each model. The results of our evaluation indicate
that CL-CNG, despite its simple approach, is the best choice to rank
and compare texts across languages if they are syntactically related.
CL-ESA almost matches the performance of CL-CNG, but on arbitrary
pairs of languages. CL-ASA works best on exact translations but does
not generalize well.},

printing in general is not new, the way of using them within a similarity
search as described here

is: Instead of computing the similarity between two fingerprints in
order to access the similarity

between the associated objects, simply the event of a fingerprint
collision is used for a similarity

assessment. The main impact of this approach is the small number of
comparisons necessary to

conduct a similarity search.},

abstract = {The goal of this research is to propose a new

ontology-based semantic similarity measure and apply it into

the biomedical domain. We also apply the ontology-based

semantic similarity measures from NLP into the biomedicine

domain within the framework of the UMLS. The proposed

measure is based on the path length between the concept nodes

as well as the depth of the lcs node in the ontology hierarchy

tree. The proposed similarity method was evaluated relative to

human experts’ ratings, and compared with the existing

measures on sets of concepts using the MeSH terminology

within the UMLS. The experimental results validate the

efficiency of the proposed method, and demonstrate that our

semantic similarity measure, compared with the existing

techniques, gives the best overall results of correlation with

experts’ ratings.},

abstract = {Traditional online dental education courses follow the broadcast paradigm which centers on the teacher, not the student. This one-size-fits-all approach resembles a mass-production idea which cannot take individual learner characteristics into account. Most online course designs do not address the issue that users with different goals and knowledge may be interested in different pieces of information about a topic. Adaptive hypermedia (AH) is an emerging field in education research which investigates how computer systems can overcome this problem. AH can be applied to any course content. This learner-centered approach first considers the learning goal(s), then evaluates the user's abilities and determines the individual learning style, to structure and tailor the curriculum most efficiently. The presented AH environment exploits various concepts of AH. The system collects data to create a model of the individual user, which is continuously refined based on test results throughout the course. The system then adapts the learning material dynamically, using active and passive curriculum sequencing and adaptive presentation.},

Using different similarity metrics, we demonstrated that articles linked by SLCs are highly related. We also showed that only half of SLCs are found among PubMed related article links. Additionally, we discuss how the citing sentence of an SLC explains the connection between two articles.},

abstract = {Current concerns about plagiarism participate in a culture-wide anxiety
that mirrors the cultural climate in previous textual revolutions.
In today's revolution, the Internet is described as the cause of
a perceived increase in plagiarism, and plagiarism-detecting services
(PDSs) are described as the best solution. The role of the Internet
should be understood, however, not just in terms of access to text
but also in terms of textual relationships. Synthesizing representations
of iText with literary theories of intertextuality suggests that
all writers work intertextually, all readers interpret texts intertextually,
and new media not only increase the number of texts through which

technologies in which unacknowledged appropriation from sources does
not necessarily invalidate the text. Plagiarism-detecting services,
in contrast, describe textual appropriation solely in terms of individual
ethics. The best response to concerns about plagiarism is revised
institutional plagiarism policies combined with authentic pedagogy

institutions of higher education at the end of 2006. While their
total number has remained almost unchanged since the mid-1990s, the
proportion of female profess ors has risen steadily since 1995. The
share of women holding profes sorships increased from 8 \% to 15 \%
over that period, with the number of female profes sors reaching
a new record level of some 5,700 in 2006. At the end of 2006, a total
of about 501,400 pers ons were employed at German institutions of
higher education. That was an increase of 4,200 employees or 0.8

in recent years. This trend has been accentuated by the global integration
of European states and the vanishing cultural and social boundaries.
Multilingual text processing has become an important field bringing
a lot of new and interesting problems. This paper describes a novel
approach to multilingual plagiarism detection. We propose a new method
called MLPlag for plagiarism detection in multilingual environment.
This method is based on analysis of word positions. It utilizes the
EuroWordNet thesaurus which transforms words into language independent
form. This allows to identify documents plagiarized from sources
written in other languages. Special techniques, such as semantic-based
word normalization, were incorporated to refine our method. It identifies
the replacement of synonyms used by plagiarists to hide the document
match. We performed and evaluated our experiments on monolingual
and multilingual corpora and results are presented in this paper.},

abstract = {It is relatively easy to detect exact matches in Web documents; however,
detecting similar content in distinct Web documents with different
words and sentence structures is a much more difficult task. A reliable
tool for determining the degree of similarity between any two Web
documents could help filter or retain Web documents with similar
content. Most methods for detecting similarity between documents
rely on some kind of textual fingerprinting or a process of looking
for exactly matched substrings. This may not be sufficient as changing
the sentence structure or replacing words with synonyms can cause
sentences with similarsame content to be treated as different. In
this paper, we develop a sentence-based Fuzzy Set Information Retrieval
(IR) approach, using word clusters that capture the similarity between
different words for discovering similar documents. Our approach has
the advantages of detecting documents with similar, but not necessarily
the same, sentences based on fuzzy-word sets. The three different
fuzzy-word clustering techniques that we have considered include
the correlation cluster, the association cluster, and the metric
cluster, which generate the word-to-word correlation values. Experimental
results show that by adopting the metric cluster, our similarity
detection approach has high accurate rate in detecting similar documents
and improves previous Fuzzy Set IR approaches based solely on the
correlation cluster.},

@article{Jung2007,
abstract = {"Is there a biology of intelligence which is characteristic of the normal human nervous system?" Here we review 37 modern neuroimaging studies in an attempt to address this question posed by Halstead (1947) as he and other icons of the last century endeavored to understand how brain and behavior are linked through the expression of intelligence and reason. Reviewing studies from functional (i.e., functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography) and structural (i.e., magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffusion tensor imaging, voxel-based morphometry) neuroimaging paradigms, we report a striking consensus suggesting that variations in a distributed network predict individual differences found on intelligence and reasoning tasks. We describe this network as the Parieto-Frontal Integration Theory (P-FIT). The P-FIT model includes, by Brodmann areas (BAs): the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BAs 6, 9, 10, 45, 46, 47), the inferior (BAs 39, 40) and superior (BA 7) parietal lobule, the anterior cingulate (BA 32), and regions within the temporal (BAs 21, 37) and occipital (BAs 18, 19) lobes. White matter regions (i.e., arcuate fasciculus) are also implicated. The P-FIT is examined in light of findings from human lesion studies, including missile wounds, frontal lobotomy/leukotomy, temporal lobectomy, and lesions resulting in damage to the language network (e.g., aphasia), as well as findings from imaging research identifying brain regions under significant genetic control. Overall, we conclude that modern neuroimaging techniques are beginning to articulate a biology of intelligence. We propose that the P-FIT provides a parsimonious account for many of the empirical observations, to date, which relate individual differences in intelligence test scores to variations in brain structure and function. Moreover, the model provides a framework for testing new hypotheses in future experimental designs.},

abstract = {Plagiarism aims at identifying the amount of information that is copied
or reproduced in modified representation of original documents. This
is quiet common among students, researchers and academicians that
leads to a kind of unrecognizing. Though there exits some commercial
tools to detect plagiarism, still plagiarism is tricky and quiet
challenging task due to abundant information available online. Commercially
existing softwares adopt methods like paraphrasing, sentence matching
or keyword matching. This paper focuses its attention on identifying
some key parameters that would help to identify plagiarism in a better
manner and to report plagiarism in an effective way. The result seems
to be promising and have further scope in detecting the plagiarism.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to give a comprehensive comparison of well-known
longest common subsequence algorithms (for two input strings) and
study their behaviour in various application environments. The performance
of the methods depends heavily on the properties of the problem instance
as well as the supporting data structures used in the implementation.
We want to make also a clear distinction between methods that determine
the actual lcs and those calculating only its length, since the execution
time and more importantly, the space demand depends crucially on
the type of the task. To our knowledge, this is the first time this
kind of survey has been done. Due to the page limits, the paper gives
only a coarse overview of the performance of the algorithms; more
detailed studies are reported elsewhere},

an algorithm for finding longest common subsequences without constraints.

@inproceedings{Lyon01,
abstract = {This paper presents a statistical method for fingerprinting text.
In a large collection of independently written documents each text
is associated with a fingerprint which should be different from all
the others. If fingerprints are too close then it is suspected that
passages of copied or similar text occur in two documents. Our method
exploits the characteristic distribution of word trigrams, and measures
to determine similarity are based on set theoretic principles. The
system was developed using a corpus of broadcast news reports and
has been successfully used to detect plagiarism in students' work.
It can find small sections that are similar as well as those that
are identical. The method is very simple and effective, but seems
not to have been used before},

abstract = {Various approaches for plagiarism detection exist. All are based on
more or less sophisticated text analysis methods such as string matching,
fingerprinting or style comparison. In this paper a new approach
called Citation-based Plagiarism Detection is evaluated using a doctoral
thesis, in which a volunteer crowd-sourcing project called GuttenPlag
identified substantial amounts of plagiarism through careful manual
inspection. This new approach is able to identify similar and plagiarized
documents based on the citations used in the text. It is shown that
citation-based plagiarism detection performs significantly better
than text-based procedures in identifying strong paraphrasing, translation
and some idea plagiarism. Detection rates can be improved by combining
citation-based with text-based plagiarism detection.},

biomedical knowledge base, is expanding at an increasing rate. Among
the tools that can aid researchers in coping with this information

has been made in applying text mining to named entity recognition,
text classification, terminology extraction, relationship extraction
and hypothesis generation. Several research groups are constructing
integrated flexible text-mining systems intended for multiple uses.
The major challenge of biomedical text mining over the next 5‚\"{A}\`{\i}10
years is to make these systems useful to biomedical researchers.
This will require enhanced access to full text, better understanding
of the feature space of biomedical literature, better methods for
measuring the usefulness of systems to users, and continued cooperation

mind when looking at how different authors of scientific papers describe
a piece of related prior work. It turns out that different citations
to the same paper often focus on different aspects of that paper
and that neither provides a full description of its full set of contributions.
In this article, we will describe our investigation of this phenomenon.
We studied citation summaries in the context of research papers in
the biomedical domain. A citation summary is the set of citing sentences
for a given article and can be used as a surrogate for the actual
article in a variety of scenarios. It contains information that was
deemed by peers to be important. Our study shows that citation summaries
overlap to some extent with the abstracts of the papers and that
they also differ from them in that they focus on different aspects
of these papers than do the abstracts. In addition to this, co-cited
articles (which are pairs of articles cited by another article) tend
to be similar. We show results based on a lexical similarity metric
called cohesion to justify our claims.},

abstract = {Motivation: The most widely used literature search techniques, such
as those offered by NCBI's PubMed system, require significant effort
on the part of the searcher, and inexperienced searchers do not use
these systems as effectively as experienced users. Improved literature
search engines can save researchers time and effort by making it
easier to locate the most important and relevant literature.Results:
We have created and optimized a new, hybrid search system for Medline
that takes natural text as input and then delivers results with high
precision and recall. The combination of a fast, low-sensitivity
weighted keyword-based first pass algorithm to cast a wide net to
gather an initial set of literature, followed by a unique sentence-alignment
based similarity algorithm to rank order those results was developed
that is sensitive, fast and easy to use. Several text similarity
search algorithms, both standard and novel, were implemented and
tested in order to determine which obtained the best results in information
retrieval exercises.Availability: Literature searching algorithms
are implemented in a system called eTBLAST, freely accessible over
the web at http:invention.swmed.edu. A variety of other derivative
systems and visualization tools provides the user with an enhanced
experience and additional capabilities.Contact:Harold.Garner@UTSouthwestern.edu},

abstract = {Semantic Similarity relates to computing the similarity between concepts,
having

the same meaning or related information, which are not lexicographically
similar.

This is an important problem in Natural Language Processing and Information
Re-

trieval Research and has received considerable attention in the literature.
Several

algorithmic approaches for computing semantic similarity have been
proposed. We

investigate approaches for computing semantic similarity by mapping
terms or con-

cepts to an ontology and by examining their relationships in that
ontology. Comparing

concepts that belong to di®erent ontologies is far more di±cult problem.
Some of the

most popular semantic similarity approaches are implemented and evaluated
based

on WordNet 1 as the underlying reference ontology. We also propose
a method for

comparing terms in di®erent ontologies. In this work we examined similarity
between

terms basically from MeSH 2 (medical) and WordNet ontologies.

Building upon the idea of semantic similarity we also propose an information
re-

trieval methodology capable of detecting similarities between documents
containing

semantically similar but not necessarily identical terms. Our proposed
Information

Retrieval model has been evaluated for retrieval of documents in Medline
3 database.

The experimental results demonstrated that our proposed model (although
slower)

achieves signi ̄cant performance improvements compared to the state-of-the-art

proach based on the Vector Space Model.},

abstract = {The authors surveyed 2,010 biomedical trainees in the fall of 1990
at the University of California, San Diego, regarding their perceptions
about unethical practices in research and the extent of their training
exposure to the ethics of scientific investigation, 549 responded,
representing both clinical and basic science departments and including
graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in addition to medical
students, residents, and fellows. Of the 549 trainees, 129 (23\%)
responded that they had received no training in research ethics;
195 (36\%), that they had observed some kind of scientific misconduct
(although not necessarily in the sense of research fraud defined
in federal regulations); and 81 (15\%), that they would be willing
to select, omit, or fabricate data to win a grant or publish a paper.
The trainees planning an academic career were more likely to report
having been aware of others' scientific misconduct. Reported exposure
to ethics training was not associated with a difference in past or
potential unethical behavior. The authors conclude that while the
apparent ineffectiveness of past ethics instruction does not preclude
the possibility that more systematic training may be useful, it does
underscore the need to assess the efficacy of training activities.},

abstract = { <sec> <title>Background<title> <p>We investigate the accuracy of
different similarity approaches for clustering over two million biomedical
documents. Clustering large sets of text documents is important for
a variety of information needs and applications such as collection
management and navigation, summary and analysis. The few comparisons
of clustering results from different similarity approaches have focused
on small literature sets and have given conflicting results. Our
study was designed to seek a robust answer to the question of which
similarity approach would generate the most coherent clusters of
a biomedical literature set of over two million documents.<p> <sec>
<sec> <title>Methodology<title> <p>We used a corpus of 2.15 million
recent (2004-2008) records from MEDLINE, and generated nine different
document-document similarity matrices from information extracted
from their bibliographic records, including titles, abstracts and
subject headings. The nine approaches were comprised of five different
analytical techniques with two data sources. The five analytical
techniques are cosine similarity using term frequency-inverse document
frequency vectors (tf-idf cosine), latent semantic analysis (LSA),
topic modeling, and two Poisson-based language models – BM25 and
PMRA (PubMed Related Articles). The two data sources were a) MeSH
subject headings, and b) words from titles and abstracts. Each similarity
matrix was filtered to keep the top-n highest similarities per document
and then clustered using a combination of graph layout and average-link
clustering. Cluster results from the nine similarity approaches were
compared using (1) within-cluster textual coherence based on the
Jensen-Shannon divergence, and (2) two concentration measures based
on grant-to-article linkages indexed in MEDLINE.<p> <sec> <sec> <title>Conclusions<title>
<p>PubMed's own related article approach (PMRA) generated the most
coherent and most concentrated cluster solution of the nine text-based
similarity approaches tested, followed closely by the BM25 approach
using titles and abstracts. Approaches using only MeSH subject headings
were not competitive with those based on titles and abstracts.<p>

abstract = {In a digital library system, documents are available in digital form
and therefore are more easily copied and their copyrights are more
easily violated. This is a very serious problem, as it discourages
owners of valuable information from sharing it with authorized users.
There are two main philosophies for addressing this problem: prevention
and detection. The former actually makes unauthorized use of documents
difficult or impossible while the latter makes it easier to discover
such activity. In this paper we propose a system for registering
documents and then detecting copies, either complete copies or partial
copies. We describe algorithms for such detection, and metrics required
for evaluating detection mechanisms (covering accuracy, eficiency,
and security). We also describe a working prototype, called COPS,
describe implementation issues, and present experimental results
that suggest the proper settings for copy detection parameters.},

@inproceedings{MeyerzuEissen05,
abstract = {In text-based information retrieval, which is the predominant retrieval
task at present, several document models have been proposed, such
as boolean, probabilistic, or (extended) vector models [Baeza-Yates
and Ribeiro-Neto 1999]. Interestingly, the suffix tree document model
is usually not discussed in the literature on the subject though
it comes along with a property that sets it apart from the other
models: It encodes information about word order. The suffix tree
document model owes much of its popularity from the Vivisimo search
engine, which operationalizes on-the-fly categorization of Internet
search results. While the classical document models can be considered
as vectors of words, the suffix tree document model as well as the
related similarity measures are graph-based. Both types of document
models provide an efficient means to compute document similarities,
and, according to various publications, both types of document models
work well in practice. However, there is no comparison between both
paradigms that explains the concepts of one in terms of the other,
or that contrasts their advantages and disadvantages with respect
to certain retrieval tasks. In this paper we start to tackle this
gap by shading light on the following questions: (1) How does similarity
computation work in the suffix tree document model? (2) Based on
the insights of Question 1, is it possible to combine concepts of
both document model types within classification or categorization
tasks? (3) Which of the document model types is more powerful with
respect to unsupervised document classification?},

@inproceedings{Yang06,
abstract = {When faculty members are evaluated, they are judged in part by the
impact and quality of their scholarly publications. While all academic
institutions look to publication counts and venues as well as the
subjective opinions of peers, many hiring, tenure, and promotion
committees also rely on citation analysis to obtain a more objective
assessment of an author’s work. Consequently, faculty members try
to identify as many citations to their published works as possible
to provide a comprehensive assessment of their publication impact
on the scholarly and professional communities. The Institute for
Scientific Information’s (ISI) citation databases, which are widely
used as a starting point if not the only source for locating citations,
have several limitations that may leave gaps in the coverage of citations
to an author’s work. This paper presents a case study comparing citations
found in Scopus and Google Scholar with those found in Web of Science
(the portal used to search the three ISI citation databases) for
items published by two Library and Information Science full-time
faculty members. In addition, the paper presents a brief overview
of a prototype system called CiteSearch, which analyzes combined
data from multiple citation databases to produce citation-based quality
evaluation measures.},

abstract = {The incidence and causes of cheating were investigated using a questionnaire,
consisting of 21 cheating behaviors, which was distributed to students
at an English university. Respondents were asked to indicate, confidentially,
which of the behaviors they had engaged in. Reported cheating was
widespread and some types of cheating (e.g., on coursework) were
more common than others. Reported cheating was more common in men
than women; more common with less able students than more able ones;
more common in younger students than mature ones; and more common
in science and technology students than those in other disciplines.
It is suggested that students' motivation, in particular whether
they are studying to learn rather than simply to obtain good grades,
is a major factor in explaining these differences. The results also
indicate that cheating consists of a number of different types of
behavior rather than being a unitary concept.},

on position-by-position matching. In composition alignment, we extend
the matching concept to composition matching. Two strings have a
composition match if their lengths are equal and they have the same
nucleotide content. We define the composition alignment problem and
give a dynamic programming solution. We explore several composition
match weighting functions and show that composition alignment with
one class of these can be computed in O( nm) time, the same as for
standard alignment. We discuss statistical properties of composition
alignment scores and demonstrate the ability of the algorithm to
detect regions of similar composition in eukaryotic promoter sequences
in the absence of detectable similarity through standard alignment.},
