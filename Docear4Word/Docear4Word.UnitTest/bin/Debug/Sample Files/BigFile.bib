% When updating this file with the svn-system, please follow the general
% format:

% 1. The key is formed as follows:
%    - First the last name of the first author in full
%    - Then for each other author the first letter of its last name
%    - Then the last two digits of the year of publication
%    - In case there are more papers with the same key, then make
%      the second and further distinct by adding an "a", "b", etc.
%    - There is one exception (see RobertsonS1 etc.)
%    
% 2. Put the paper in place where it is sorted according to the following
%    rules:
%    - Papers are first sorted with respect to the last name of the first
%      author
%    - Then, the year of appearance is used
%    - And then (but the file doesn't follow the rule always), use the rest
%      of the key (names of other authors, year)
%    - At the end of the file, there are references without list of authors
%      (e.g., websites)
%    - In comments, guidelines for alphabetical ordening and searching are
%      given
%
% 3. Use { and } for the enclosing of strings, not " ".
%
% The file has first some string definitions - you can guess the system
% and, if useful, add similar definitions, and then the papers in order
% as described above.
% 

%
% For many years, I added many papers to my bibtex-file. The system is
% more or less as designed back then, plus some modifications made
% over the years.
