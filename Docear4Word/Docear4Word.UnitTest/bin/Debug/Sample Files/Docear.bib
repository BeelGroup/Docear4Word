  abstract = {Sequence analysis is a major area in bioinformatics encompassing the
	methods and techniques for studying the biological sequences, DNA,
	RNA, and proteins, on the linear structure level. The focus of this
	area is generally on the identification of intra– and inter–molecular
	similarities. Identifying intra–molecular similarities boils down
	to detecting repeated segments within a given sequence, while identifying
	inter–molecular similarities amounts to spotting common segments
	among two or multiple sequences. From a data mining point of view,
	sequence analysis is nothing but string- or pattern mining specific
	to biological strings. For a long time, this point of view, however,
	has not been explicitly embraced neither in the data mining nor in
	the sequence analysis text books, which may be attributed to the
	co-evolution of the two apparently independent fields. In other words,
	although the word data-mining is almost missing in the sequence analysis
	literature, its basic concepts have been implicitly applied. Interestingly,
	recent research in biological sequence analysis introduced efficient
	solutions to many problems in data mining, such as querying and analyzing
	time series [49,53], extracting information from web pages [20],
	fighting spam mails [50], detecting plagiarism [22], and spotting
	duplications in software systems [14].},

	different similarity approaches for clustering over two million biomedical
	documents. Clustering large sets of text documents is important for
	a variety of information needs and applications such as collection
	management and navigation, summary and analysis. The few comparisons
	of clustering results from different similarity approaches have focused
	on small literature sets and have given conflicting results. Our
	study was designed to seek a robust answer to the question of which
	similarity approach would generate the most coherent clusters of
	a biomedical literature set of over two million documents.<p> <sec>
	<sec> <title>Methodology<title> <p>We used a corpus of 2.15 million
	recent (2004-2008) records from MEDLINE, and generated nine different
	document-document similarity matrices from information extracted
	from their bibliographic records, including titles, abstracts and
	subject headings. The nine approaches were comprised of five different
	analytical techniques with two data sources. The five analytical
	techniques are cosine similarity using term frequency-inverse document
	frequency vectors (tf-idf cosine), latent semantic analysis (LSA),
	topic modeling, and two Poisson-based language models – BM25 and
	PMRA (PubMed Related Articles). The two data sources were a) MeSH
	subject headings, and b) words from titles and abstracts. Each similarity
	matrix was filtered to keep the top-n highest similarities per document
	and then clustered using a combination of graph layout and average-link

	und einer Anzahl von Dokumenten. Es werden erste Dokumente und zweite
	Dokumente ermittelt, welche direkt oder indirekt von dem Eingabedokument

	(EN) The invention relates to a computer-implemented method for detecting
	a similarity between at least one input document and a plurality
	of documents. First documents and second documents are detected which
	are directly or indirectly cited by the input document or which directly
	or indirectly cite the input document. At least one preliminary similarity
	value is calculated for every detected document. If more than one
	preliminary similarity value has been calculated for a document,
	a final similarity value is calculated from the preliminary similarity
	values. The method can then be applied to the detected first documents
	and second documents to detect further documents that are similar
	to the input document and to calculate their similarity values to
	the input document.

	d'entrée. Au moins une valeur de similarité provisoire est calculée
	pour chaque document déterminé. Si plus d'une valeur de similarité
	provisoire a été calculée pour un document, une valeur de similarité
	définitive est calculée à partir des valeurs de similarité provisoire.
	Ce procédé peut encore être appliqué aux premiers et aux deuxièmes
	documents déterminés pour déterminer d'autres documents similaires
	au document d'entrée et pour calculer leurs valeurs de similarité
	par rapport au document d'entrée.},

	in order to detect regions with similar nucleotide composition. Our
	algorithm, which we call composition alignment or, more whimsically,
	scrambled alignment, employs the mechanisms of string matching and
	string comparison yet avoids the overdependence of those methods
	on position-by-position matching. In composition alignment, we extend
	the matching concept to composition matching. Two strings have a
	composition match if their lengths are equal and they have the same
	nucleotide content. We define the composition alignment problem and
	give a dynamic programming solution. We explore several composition
	match weighting functions and show that composition alignment with
	one class of these can be computed in O( nm) time, the same as for
	standard alignment. We discuss statistical properties of composition
	alignment scores and demonstrate the ability of the algorithm to
	detect regions of similar composition in eukaryotic promoter sequences
	in the absence of detectable similarity through standard alignment.},

  abstract = {Social resource sharing systems are central elements of the Web 2.0
	and use the same kind of lightweight knowledge representation, called
	folksonomy. Their large user communities and ever-growing networks
	of user-generated content have made them an attractive object of
	investigation for researchers from different disciplines like Social
	Network Analysis, Data Mining, Information Retrieval or Knowledge
	Discovery. In this paper, we summarize and extend our work on different
	aspects of this branch of Web 2.0 research, demonstrated and evaluated
	within our own social bookmark and publication sharing system BibSonomy,
	which is currently among the three most popular systems of its kind.
	We structure this presentation along the different interaction phases
	of a user with our system, coupling the relevant research questions
	of each phase with the corresponding implementation issues. This
	approach reveals in a systematic fashion important aspects and results
	of the broad bandwidth of folksonomy research like capturing of emergent
	semantics, spam detection, ranking algorithms, analogies to search
	engine log data, personalized tag recommendations and information
	extraction techniques. We conclude that when integrating a real-life
	application like BibSonomy into research, certain constraints have
	to be considered; but in general, the tight interplay between our
	scientific work and the running system has made BibSonomy a valuable
	platform for demonstrating and evaluating Web 2.0 research.},

	There are two main philosophies for addressing this problem: prevention
	and detection. The former actually makes unauthorized use of documents
	difficult or impossible while the latter makes it easier to discover
	such activity. In this paper we propose a system for registering
	documents and then detecting copies, either complete copies or partial
	copies. We describe algorithms for such detection, and metrics required
	for evaluating detection mechanisms (covering accuracy, eficiency,
	and security). We also describe a working prototype, called COPS,
	describe implementation issues, and present experimental results
	that suggest the proper settings for copy detection parameters.},

	is based on converting the digital submission into text form for
	processing by a plagiarism detection algorithm. To process non-text
	submissions, the system is extended with the appropriate converter.
	Such an open architecture makes the anti-plagiarism toolbox universal
	and easily adaptable for processing virtually any kind of digital
	submissions. This paper describes a software prototype based on the

	research. Relevance judgments, which are necessary
	
	for system evaluation, are expensive; the cost of obtaining
	
	them prohibits in-house evaluation of retrieval systems
	
	on new corpora or new topics. We present an algorithm
	
	for cheaply constructing sets of relevance judgments. Our
	
	method intelligently selects documents to be judged and decides
	
	when to stop in such a way that with very little work
	
	there can be a high degree of condence in the result of the
	
	evaluation. We demonstrate the algorithm's eectiveness by
	
	showing that it produces small sets of relevance judgments
	
	that reliably discriminate between two systems. The algorithm
	
	can be used to incrementally design retrieval systems
	
	by simultaneously comparing sets of systems. The number
	
	of additional judgments needed after each incremental design
	
	change decreases at a rate reciprocal to the number
	
	of systems being compared. To demonstrate the eectiveness
	
	of our method, we evaluate TREC ad hoc submissions,
	
	showing that with 95% fewer relevance judgments we can
	
	reach a Kendall's tau rank correlation of at least 0.9.},

	in recent years. This trend has been accentuated by the global integration
	of European states and the vanishing cultural and social boundaries.
	Multilingual text processing has become an important field bringing
	a lot of new and interesting problems. This paper describes a novel
	approach to multilingual plagiarism detection. We propose a new method
	called MLPlag for plagiarism detection in multilingual environment.
	This method is based on analysis of word positions. It utilizes the
	EuroWordNet thesaurus which transforms words into language independent
	form. This allows to identify documents plagiarized from sources
	written in other languages. Special techniques, such as semantic-based
	word normalization, were incorporated to refine our method. It identifies
	the replacement of synonyms used by plagiarists to hide the document
	match. We performed and evaluated our experiments on monolingual
	and multilingual corpora and results are presented in this paper.},

	evaluation refers to the appraisal of a theory by observation in
	experiments. The key to good empirical evaluation is the proper design
	and execution of the experiments so that the particular factors to
	be tested can be easily separated from other confounding factors.
	For example, one may want to test whether a software system with
	a user model works better than the same system without a user model,
	test the effect of different levels of user modeling or different
	user model parameter settings, or test different user interfaces.

	have engaged in some form of misconduct while completing their academic
	work, despite knowing that such behaviour is ethically or morally
	wrong. U.S.-based studies have also identified myriad personal and
	institutional factors associated with academic misconduct. Implicit
	in some of these factors are several institutional strategies that
	may be implemented to support academic integrity: revisiting the
	values and goals of higher education, recommitting to quality in
	teaching and assessment practice, establishing effective policies
	and invigilation practices, providing educational opportunities and
	support for all members of the university community, and using (modified)
	academic honour codes. There is a dearth of similar research in Canada
	despite growing recognition that academic misconduct is a problem
	on Canadian campuses. This paper suggests that Canadian higher education
	can learn much from the U.S. experience and calls for both a recommitment
	to academic integrity and research on academic misconduct in Canadian
	higher education institutions.},

	and that neither provides a full description of its full set of contributions.
	In this article, we will describe our investigation of this phenomenon.
	We studied citation summaries in the context of research papers in
	the biomedical domain. A citation summary is the set of citing sentences
	for a given article and can be used as a surrogate for the actual
	article in a variety of scenarios. It contains information that was
	deemed by peers to be important. Our study shows that citation summaries
	overlap to some extent with the abstracts of the papers and that
	they also differ from them in that they focus on different aspects
	of these papers than do the abstracts. In addition to this, co-cited
	articles (which are pairs of articles cited by another article) tend
	to be similar. We show results based on a lexical similarity metric
	called cohesion to justify our claims.},

	corpus, has been difficult to detect, and studies this far have been
	limited in scope and size. Using text similarity searches, we were
	able to identify signatures of duplicate citations among a body of
	abstracts.Results: A sample of 62 213 Medline citations was examined
	and a database of manually verified duplicate citations was created
	to study author publication behavior. We found that 0.04% of the
	citations with no shared authors were highly similar and are thus
	potential cases of plagiarism. 1.35% with shared authors were sufficiently
	similar to be considered a duplicate. Extrapolating, this would correspond
	to 3500 and 117 500 duplicate citations in total, respectively.Availability:

	Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to identify the most popular
	techniques used to rank a web page highly in Google.
	
	
	Designmethodologyapproach – The paper presents the results of a study
	into 50 highly optimized web pages that were created as part of a
	Search Engine Optimization competition. The study focuses on the
	most popular techniques that were used to rank highest in this competition,
	and includes an analysis on the use of PageRank, number of pages,
	number of in-links, domain age and the use of third party sites such
	as directories and social bookmarking sites. A separate study was
	made into 50 non-optimized web pages for comparison.
	
	
	Findings – The paper provides insight into the techniques that successful
	Search Engine Optimizers use to ensure a page ranks highly in Google.
	Recognizes the importance of PageRank and links as well as directories
	and social bookmarking sites.
	
	
	Research limitationsimplications – Only the top 50 web sites for a
	specific query were analyzed. Analysing more web sites and comparing
	with similar studies in different competition would provide more
	concrete results.
	
	
	Practical implications – The paper offers a revealing insight into
	the techniques used by industry experts to rank highly in Google,
	and the success or otherwise of those techniques.
	
	
	Originalityvalue – This paper fulfils an identified need for web sites
	and e-commerce sites keen to attract a wider web audience.},

	between “top k lists.” Some of these distance measures are metrics,
	while others are not. For each of these latter distance measures,
	we show that they are “almost” a metric in the following two seemingly
	unrelated aspects:
	
	(i) they satisfy a relaxed version of the polygonal (hence, triangle)
	inequality, and
	
	(ii) there is a metric with positive constant multiples that bound
	our measure above and below. 
	
	This is not a coincidence—we show that these two notions of almost
	being a metric are same. Based on the second notion, we define two
	distance measures to be equivalent if they are bounded above and
	below by constant multiples of each other. We thereby identify a
	large and robust equivalence class of distance measures.
	
	Besides the applications to the task of identifying good notions of
	(dis-)similarity between two top k lists, our results imply polynomial-time
	constant-factor approximation algorithms for the rank aggregation
	problem with respect to a large class of distance measures.},

	cheating on assignments by plagiarising others' work. By the same
	token, Web-based tools offer the potential for instructors to check
	submitted assignments for signs of plagiarism. Overlap-detection
	tools are easy to use and accurate in plagiarism detection, so they
	can be an excellent deterrent to plagiarism. Documents can overlap
	for other reasons, too: Old documents are superseded, and authors
	summarize previous work identically in several papers. Overlap-detection
	tools can pinpoint interconnections in a corpus of documents and
	could be used in search engines.We describe a web-accessible text
	registry based on signature extraction. We extract a small but diagnostic
	signature from each registered text for permanent storage and comparison
	against other stored signatures. This comparison allows us to estimate
	the amount of overlap between pairs of documents, although the total
	time required is linear in the total size of the documents. We compare
	our algorithm with several alternatives and present both efficiency
	and accuracy results.},

	more or less sophisticated text analysis methods such as string matching,

	called Citation-based Plagiarism Detection is evaluated using a doctoral
	thesis, in which a volunteer crowd-sourcing project called GuttenPlag
	identified substantial amounts of plagiarism through careful manual
	inspection. This new approach is able to identify similar and plagiarized
	documents based on the citations used in the text. It is shown that
	citation-based plagiarism detection performs significantly better
	than text-based procedures in identifying strong paraphrasing, translation
	and some idea plagiarism. Detection rates can be improved by combining
	citation-based with text-based plagiarism detection.},

  abstract = {Objective To understand belief in a specific scientific claim by studying
	the pattern of citations among papers stating it.Design A complete
	citation network was constructed from all PubMed indexed English
	literature papers addressing the belief that β amyloid, a protein
	accumulated in the brain in Alzheimer’s disease, is produced by and
	injures skeletal muscle of patients with inclusion body myositis.
	Social network theory and graph theory were used to analyse this
	network.Main outcome measures Citation bias, amplification, and invention,
	and their effects on determining authority.Results The network contained
	242 papers and 675 citations addressing the belief, with 220 553
	citation paths supporting it. Unfounded authority was established
	by citation bias against papers that refuted or weakened the belief;
	amplification, the marked expansion of the belief system by papers
	presenting no data addressing it; and forms of invention such as
	the conversion of hypothesis into fact through citation alone. Extension
	of this network into text within grants funded by the National Institutes
	of Health and obtained through the Freedom of Information Act showed
	the same phenomena present and sometimes used to justify requests
	for funding.Conclusion Citation is both an impartial scholarly method
	and a powerful form of social communication. Through distortions
	in its social use that include bias, amplification, and invention,
	citation can be used to generate information cascades resulting in
	unfounded authority of claims. Construction and analysis of a claim
	specific citation network may clarify the nature of a published belief
	system and expose distorted methods of social citation.},

	that mirrors the cultural climate in previous textual revolutions.
	In today's revolution, the Internet is described as the cause of
	a perceived increase in plagiarism, and plagiarism-detecting services
	(PDSs) are described as the best solution. The role of the Internet
	should be understood, however, not just in terms of access to text
	but also in terms of textual relationships. Synthesizing representations
	of iText with literary theories of intertextuality suggests that
	all writers work intertextually, all readers interpret texts intertextually,
	and new media not only increase the number of texts through which
	both writers and readers work but also offer interactive information
	technologies in which unacknowledged appropriation from sources does
	not necessarily invalidate the text. Plagiarism-detecting services,
	in contrast, describe textual appropriation solely in terms of individual
	ethics. The best response to concerns about plagiarism is revised
	institutional plagiarism policies combined with authentic pedagogy
	that derives from an understanding of IText, intertextuality, and
	new media.},

	This is an important problem in Natural Language Processing and Information
	Re-
	
	trieval Research and has received considerable attention in the literature.
	Several
	
	algorithmic approaches for computing semantic similarity have been
	proposed. We
	
	investigate approaches for computing semantic similarity by mapping
	terms or con-
	
	cepts to an ontology and by examining their relationships in that
	ontology. Comparing
	
	concepts that belong to di®erent ontologies is far more di±cult problem.
	Some of the
	
	most popular semantic similarity approaches are implemented and evaluated
	based
	
	on WordNet 1 as the underlying reference ontology. We also propose
	a method for
	
	comparing terms in di®erent ontologies. In this work we examined similarity
	between
	
	terms basically from MeSH 2 (medical) and WordNet ontologies.
	
	Building upon the idea of semantic similarity we also propose an information
	re-
	
	trieval methodology capable of detecting similarities between documents
	containing
	
	semantically similar but not necessarily identical terms. Our proposed
	Information
	
	Retrieval model has been evaluated for retrieval of documents in Medline
	3 database.
	
	The experimental results demonstrated that our proposed model (although
	slower)
	
	achieves signi ̄cant performance improvements compared to the state-of-the-art

  abstract = {Claremont McKenna College has conducted a survey of faculty,
	
	
	students, and relevant support staff to determine satisfaction levels
	with several 
	
	ant-plagiarism tools. Students were asked to compare learning products
	from 
	
	Glatt, Turnitin.com, and Prentice Hall, and high-profile plagiarism
	education 
	
	websites at Indiana University, Purdue, and University of Michigan.
	Faculty 
	
	and support staff were asked to compare plagiarism detection services
	from 
	
	Turnitin.com, Canexus (Eve2), and the University of Virginia (WCopyFind).
	
	
	Students reported a statistically significant preference for learning
	tools offered 
	
	by Prentice Hall, Purdue, Michigan, and Turnitin.com, over those offered
	by 
	
	Glatt and Indiana. With less statistical significance, students preferred
	the tools 
	
	available at Prentice Hall overall. Faculty reported a significant
	preference for 
	
	detection services through Turnitin.com over those offered by the
	University of 
	
	Virginia software, and by the Eve2 program. 
	
	
	Parallel to the collection of survey data regarding the software,
	instructors in the 
	
	Literature Department have been testing a combination of Turnitin.com’s
	
	
	detection services, and Prentice Hall’s educational software. Results
	of this 
	
	program are still preliminary, but indicate a pattern of support for
	the findings of 
	
	the survey results. After one semester of employment, the program
	does appear 
	
	to be helping faculty to detect student plagiarism, and students seem
	comfortable 
	
	both with the detection program, and with efforts to better teach
	them the rules 
	
	of academic honesty.},

	about unethical practices in research and the extent of their training
	exposure to the ethics of scientific investigation, 549 responded,
	representing both clinical and basic science departments and including
	graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in addition to medical
	students, residents, and fellows. Of the 549 trainees, 129 (23%)
	responded that they had received no training in research ethics;
	195 (36%), that they had observed some kind of scientific misconduct
	(although not necessarily in the sense of research fraud defined
	in federal regulations); and 81 (15%), that they would be willing
	to select, omit, or fabricate data to win a grant or publish a paper.
	The trainees planning an academic career were more likely to report
	having been aware of others' scientific misconduct. Reported exposure
	to ethics training was not associated with a difference in past or
	potential unethical behavior. The authors conclude that while the
	apparent ineffectiveness of past ethics instruction does not preclude
	the possibility that more systematic training may be useful, it does
	underscore the need to assess the efficacy of training activities.},

	rekindled interest in academic misconduct. Prior studies of academic
	misconduct have focussed exclusively on situational factors (e.g.,
	integrity culture, honor codes), demographic variables or personality
	constructs. We contend that it is important to also examine how these
	classes of variables interact to influence perceptions of and intentions
	relating to academic misconduct. In a sample of 217 business students,
	we examined how integrity culture interacts with Prudence and Adjustment
	to explain variance in estimated frequency of cheating, suspicions
	of cheating, considering cheating and reporting cheating. Age, integrity
	culture, and personality variables were significantly related to
	different criteria. Overall, personality variables explained the
	most unique variance in academic misconduct, and Adjustment interacted
	with integrity culture, such that integrity culture had more influence
	on intentions to cheat for less well-adjusted individuals. Implications
	for practice are discussed and future research directions are offered.},

	over a large alphabet of integers. The sorted order of suffixes of
	a string is also called suffix array, a data structure introduced
	by Manber and Myers that has numerous applications in pattern matching,
	string processing, and computational biology. Though the suffix tree
	of a string can be constructed in linear time and the sorted order
	of suffixes derived from it, a direct algorithm for suffix sorting
	is of great interest due to the space requirements of suffix trees.
	Our result improves upon the best known direct algorithm for suffix
	sorting, which takes O(n log n) time. We also show how to construct
	suffix trees in linear time from our suffix sorting result. Apart
	from being simple and applicable for alphabets not necessarily of
	fixed size, this method of constructing suffix trees is more space
	efficient.},

	detecting similar content in distinct Web documents with different
	words and sentence structures is a much more difficult task. A reliable
	tool for determining the degree of similarity between any two Web
	documents could help filter or retain Web documents with similar
	content. Most methods for detecting similarity between documents
	rely on some kind of textual fingerprinting or a process of looking
	for exactly matched substrings. This may not be sufficient as changing
	the sentence structure or replacing words with synonyms can cause
	sentences with similarsame content to be treated as different. In
	this paper, we develop a sentence-based Fuzzy Set Information Retrieval
	(IR) approach, using word clusters that capture the similarity between
	different words for discovering similar documents. Our approach has
	the advantages of detecting documents with similar, but not necessarily
	the same, sentences based on fuzzy-word sets. The three different
	fuzzy-word clustering techniques that we have considered include
	the correlation cluster, the association cluster, and the metric
	cluster, which generate the word-to-word correlation values. Experimental
	results show that by adopting the metric cluster, our similarity
	detection approach has high accurate rate in detecting similar documents
	and improves previous Fuzzy Set IR approaches based solely on the
	correlation cluster.},

  abstract = {Student plagiarism, the process where a student uses the words or
	ideas of another 
	
	without acknowledgement and for academic credit, is believed to be
	increasing. This 
	
	is of concern since it devalues the awards that academic institutions
	make and has 
	
	recently been receiving increased media attention. This thesis presents
	a process 
	
	through which similarity within a corpus of documents can be found
	and verified by a 
	
	tutor to see if it represents plagiarism. Two key requirements for
	the process are 
	
	identified. The first is that it should be effective in that it correctly
	identifies those 
	
	documents that are the most similar. The second is that it should
	be efficient; this 
	
	means both computationally and in terms of tutor workload. 
	
	
	A number of new ideas are introduced. The literature study reveals
	that there is no 
	
	consistency in the terms used to talk about plagiarism and a taxonomy
	is proposed. It 
	
	also finds inconsistencies in classifications of detection engines
	for source code 
	
	plagiarism. Alternative classifications that do not preclude free
	text engines are 
	
	presented. The main shortcoming of existing systems is that although
	the engines 
	
	might be effective the systems they support impact too greatly on
	a tutor's time. 
	
	Hence they are not efficient. 
	
	
	A four-stage detection process consisting of collection, analysis,
	verification and 
	
	investigation is proposed. The greatest need for tool support would
	be on the labour 
	
	intensive verification and investigation stages. Here a tutor has
	to examine two 
	
	documents that have been flagged during the analysis stage. A visual
	approach to 
	
	demonstrate the similarity is recommended. A new graphic known as
	a similarity 
	
	visualisation is used that presents pixels whose intensity is generated
	by the 
	
	commonality of overlapping word fragments. The visualisations are
	deployed by an 
	
	interactive tool named VAST that allows quick verification and investigation
	of 
	
	suspect areas of the two submissions. 
	
	
	The similarity visualisation is argued to provide the best representation
	of similarity 
	
	between two submissions and an ordering of pairs based on its properties
	is argued to 
	
	be effective. Generating visualisations for all possible pairs of
	a large corpus is 
	
	considered to not be currently computationally feasible. Instead,
	this ordering is 
	
	approximated using less computationally intensive metrics. Using real
	and synthetic 
	
	submissions it is argued that the word pairs metric, based upon the
	proportion of two 
	
	consecutive words that two submissions have in common, is demonstrated
	to be the 
	
	most efficient and effective metric.},

  month = {March},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Topic detection is a task that automatically identifies
	topics (e.g., "biochemistry" and "protein structure") in scientific
	articles based on information content. Topic detection will benefit
	many other natural language processing tasks including information
	retrieval, text summarization and question answering; and is a necessary
	step towards the building of an information system that provides
	an efficient way for biologists to seek information from an ocean
	of literature.
	
	
	RESULTS: We have explored the methods of Topic Spotting, a task of
	text categorization that applies the supervised machine-learning
	technique naïve Bayes to assign automatically a document into one
	or more predefined topics; and Topic Clustering, which apply unsupervised
	hierarchical clustering algorithms to aggregate documents into clusters
	such that each cluster represents a topic. We have applied our methods
	to detect topics of more than fifteen thousand of articles that represent
	over sixteen thousand entries in the Online Mendelian Inheritance
	in Man (OMIM) database. We have explored bag of words as the features.
	Additionally, we have explored semantic features; namely, the Medical
	Subject Headings (MeSH) that are assigned to the MEDLINE records,
	and the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) semantic types that
	correspond to the MeSH terms, in addition to bag of words, to facilitate
	the tasks of topic detection. Our results indicate that incorporating
	the MeSH terms and the UMLS semantic types as additional features
	enhances the performance of topic detection and the naïve Bayes has
	the highest accuracy, 66.4%, for predicting the topic of an OMIM
	article as one of the total twenty-five topics.
	
	
	CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the supervised topic spotting
	methods outperformed the unsupervised topic clustering; on the other
	hand, the unsupervised topic clustering methods have the advantages
	of being robust and applicable in real world settings.},

	on the part of the searcher, and inexperienced searchers do not use
	these systems as effectively as experienced users. Improved literature
	search engines can save researchers time and effort by making it
	easier to locate the most important and relevant literature.Results:
	We have created and optimized a new, hybrid search system for Medline
	that takes natural text as input and then delivers results with high
	precision and recall. The combination of a fast, low-sensitivity
	weighted keyword-based first pass algorithm to cast a wide net to
	gather an initial set of literature, followed by a unique sentence-alignment
	based similarity algorithm to rank order those results was developed
	that is sensitive, fast and easy to use. Several text similarity
	search algorithms, both standard and novel, were implemented and
	tested in order to determine which obtained the best results in information
	retrieval exercises.Availability: Literature searching algorithms
	are implemented in a system called eTBLAST, freely accessible over
	the web at http:invention.swmed.edu. A variety of other derivative
	systems and visualization tools provides the user with an enhanced
	experience and additional capabilities.Contact:Harold.Garner@UTSouthwestern.edu},

	similarity called pmra that underlies the related article search
	feature in PubMed. Whether or not a document is about a particular
	topic is computed from term frequencies, modeled as Poisson distributions.
	Unlike previous probabilistic retrieval models, we do not attempt
	to estimate relevance-but rather our focus is "relatedness", the
	probability that a user would want to examine a particular document
	given known interest in another. We also describe a novel technique
	for estimating parameters that does not require human relevance judgments;
	instead, the process is based on the existence of MeSH (R) in MEDLINE
	(R).RESULTS:The pmra retrieval model was compared against bm25, a
	competitive probabilistic model that shares theoretical similarities.
	Experiments using the test collection from the TREC 2005 genomics
	track shows a small but statistically significant improvement of
	pmra over bm25 in terms of precision.CONCLUSION:Our experiments suggest
	that the pmra model provides an effective ranking algorithm for related
	article search.},

	are identical. The method is very simple and effective, but seems

	three words, the rarity of most of these triples is extreme. This
	can be exploited to detect web pages similar to a given target document:

	many hits, other triples will only be found in a few documents on
	the Internet. These documents may well be similar to the target,
	and are certainly worth examining more closely. Initial experiments
	show that this approach is very promising, and it is being implemented

  abstract = {This account of the Matthew effect is another small exercise in the
	psychosociological analysis of the workings of science as a social
	institution. The initial problem is transformed by a shift in theoretical
	perspective. As originally identified, the Matthew effect was construed
	in terms of enhancement of the position of already eminent scientists
	who are given disproportionate credit in cases of collaboration or
	of independent multiple discoveries. Its significance was thus confined
	to its implications for the reward system of science. By shifting
	the angle of vision, we note other possible kinds of consequences,
	this time for the communication system of science. The Matthew effect
	may serve to heighten the visibility of contributions to science
	by scientists of acknowledged standing and to reduce the visibility
	of contributions by authors who are less well known. We examine the
	psychosocial conditions and mechanisms underlying this effect and
	find a correlation between the redundancy function of multiple discoveries
	and the focalizing function of eminent men of science—a function
	which is reinforced by the great value these men place upon finding
	basic problems and by their self-assurance. This self-assurance,
	which is partly inherent, partly the result of experiences and associations
	in creative scientific environments, and partly a result of later
	social validation of their position, encourages them to search out
	risky but important problems and to highlight the results of their
	inquiry. A macrosocial version of the Matthew principle is apparently
	involved in those processes of social selection that currently lead
	to the concentration of scientific resources and talent (50).},

  abstract = {In text-based information retrieval, which is the predominant retrieval
	task at present, several document models have been proposed, such
	as boolean, probabilistic, or (extended) vector models [Baeza-Yates
	and Ribeiro-Neto 1999]. Interestingly, the suffix tree document model
	is usually not discussed in the literature on the subject though
	it comes along with a property that sets it apart from the other
	models: It encodes information about word order. The suffix tree
	document model owes much of its popularity from the Vivisimo search
	engine, which operationalizes on-the-fly categorization of Internet
	search results. While the classical document models can be considered
	as vectors of words, the suffix tree document model as well as the
	related similarity measures are graph-based. Both types of document
	models provide an efficient means to compute document similarities,
	and, according to various publications, both types of document models
	work well in practice. However, there is no comparison between both
	paradigms that explains the concepts of one in terms of the other,
	or that contrasts their advantages and disadvantages with respect
	to certain retrieval tasks. In this paper we start to tackle this
	gap by shading light on the following questions: (1) How does similarity
	computation work in the suffix tree document model? (2) Based on
	the insights of Question 1, is it possible to combine concepts of
	both document model types within classification or categorization
	tasks? (3) Which of the document model types is more powerful with
	respect to unsupervised document classification?},

	acid sequences of two proteins has been developed. From these findings
	it is possible to determine whether significant homology exists between
	the proteins. This information is used to trace their possible evolutionary
	development. The maximum match is a number dependent upon the similarity
	of the sequences. One of its definitions is the largest number of
	amino acids of one protein that can be matched with those of a second
	protein allowing for all possible interruptions in either of the
	sequences. While the interruptions give rise to a very large number
	of comparisons, the method efficiently excludes from consideration
	those comparisons that cannot contribute to the maximum match. Comparisons
	are made from the smallest unit of significance, a pair of amino
	acids, one from each protein. All possible pairs are represented
	by a two-dimensional array, and all possible comparisons are represented

	consisting of 21 cheating behaviors, which was distributed to students
	at an English university. Respondents were asked to indicate, confidentially,
	which of the behaviors they had engaged in. Reported cheating was
	widespread and some types of cheating (e.g., on coursework) were
	more common than others. Reported cheating was more common in men
	than women; more common with less able students than more able ones;
	more common in younger students than mature ones; and more common
	in science and technology students than those in other disciplines.
	It is suggested that students' motivation, in particular whether
	they are studying to learn rather than simply to obtain good grades,
	is a major factor in explaining these differences. The results also
	indicate that cheating consists of a number of different types of
	behavior rather than being a unitary concept.},

  abstract = {The existence of huge volumes of documents written in multiple languages
	on Internet leads to investigate novel algorithmic approaches to
	deal with information of this kind. However, most crosslingual natural
	language processing (NLP) tasks consider a decoupled approach in
	which monolingual NLP techniques are applied along with an independent
	translation process. This two-step approach is too sensitive to translation
	errors, and in general to the accumulative effect of errors. To solve
	this problem, we propose to use a direct probabilistic crosslingual
	NLP system which integrates both steps, translation and the specific
	NLP task, into a single one. In order to perform this integrated
	approach to crosslingual tasks, we propose to use the statistical
	IBM 1 word alignment model (M1). The M1 model may show a non-monotonic
	behaviour when aligning words from a sentence in a source language
	to words from another sentence in a different, target language. This
	is the case of languages with different word order. In English, for
	instance, adjectives appear before nouns, whereas in Spanish it is
	exactly the opposite. The successful experimental results reported
	in three different tasks - text classification, information retrieval
	and plagiarism analysis - highlight the benefits of the statistical
	integrated approach proposed in this work.},

  journal = {Data \& Knowledge Engineering},
  year = {2009},
  volume = {68},
  pages = {1289–1308},
  abstract = {In many research fields such as Psychology, Linguistics, Cognitive
	Science and Artificial
	
	Intelligence, computing semantic similarity between words is an important
	issue. In this
	
	paper a new semantic similarity metric, that exploits some notions
	of the feature-based
	
	theory of similarity and translates it into the information theoretic
	domain, which leverages
	
	the notion of Information Content (IC), is presented. In particular,
	the proposed metric
	
	exploits the notion of intrinsic IC which quantifies IC values by
	scrutinizing how concepts
	
	are arranged in an ontological structure. In order to evaluate this
	metric, an on line experiment
	
	asking the community of researchers to rank a list of 65 word pairs
	has been conducted.
	
	The experiment’s web setup allowed to collect 101 similarity ratings
	and to
	
	differentiate native and non-native English speakers. Such a large
	and diverse dataset
	
	enables to confidently evaluate similarity metrics by correlating
	them with human assessments.
	
	Experimental evaluations using WordNet indicate that the proposed
	metric, coupled
	
	with the notion of intrinsic IC, yields results above the state of
	the art. Moreover,
	
	the intrinsic IC formulation also improves the accuracy of other IC-based
	metrics. In order
	
	to investigate the generality of both the intrinsic IC formulation
	and proposed similarity
	
	metric a further evaluation using the MeSH biomedical ontology has
	been performed. Even
	
	in this case significant results were obtained. The proposed metric
	and several others have
	
	been implemented in the Java WordNet Similarity Library.},

  abstract = {Cross-language plagiarism detection deals with the automatic identification
	and extraction of plagiarism in a multilingual setting. In this setting,
	a suspicious document is given, and the task is to retrieve all sections
	from the document that originate from a large, multilingual document
	collection. Our contributions in this field are as follows: (1) a
	comprehensive retrieval process for cross-language plagiarism detection
	is introduced, highlighting the differences to monolingual plagiarism
	detection, (2) state-of-the-art solutions for two important subtasks
	are reviewed, (3) retrieval models for the assessment of cross-language
	similarity are surveyed, and, (4) the three models CL-CNG, CL-ESA
	and CL-ASA are compared. Our evaluation is of realistic scale: it
	relies on 120,000 test documents which are selected from the corpora
	JRC-Acquis and Wikipedia, so that for each test document highly similar
	documents are available in all of the six languages English, German,
	Spanish, French, Dutch, and Polish. The models are employed in a
	series of ranking tasks, and more than 100 million similarities are
	computed with each model. The results of our evaluation indicate
	that CL-CNG, despite its simple approach, is the best choice to rank
	and compare texts across languages if they are syntactically related.
	CL-ESA almost matches the performance of CL-CNG, but on arbitrary
	pairs of languages. CL-ASA works best on exact translations but does
	not generalize well.},

	students, is an ethical issue of concern to the academic and business
	communities. Corporate scandals and federal legislation have brought
	additional attention to the ethical behavior of business leaders
	and the role of higher education in training the leaders of tomorrow.
	If students exhibit unethical and dishonest behavior in college,
	they may carry those attitudes and behaviors into the workplace.
	This paper looks at business students' attitudes and behaviors in
	regard to academic dishonesty. The extent and causes of academic
	dishonesty are reviewed, as well as the varying degree and frequency
	of dishonest acts and related penalties. The results of this study,
	which are based on a survey that was completed by 1,255 business
	students, reflect future business leaders' attitudes toward academic
	dishonesty -- which acts are most dishonest and how those behaviors
	should be penalized -- and the extent to which they engage },

	working with many articles simultaneously to search, filter, scan,

	increase in strategic reading in the online environment will soon
	be further intensified by two current trends: (i) the widespread
	use of digital indexing, retrieval, and navigation resources and
	(ii) the emergence within many scientific disciplines of interoperable
	ontologies. Accelerated and enhanced by reading tools that take advantage
	of ontologies, reading practices will become even more rapid and
	indirect, transforming the ways in which scientists engage the literature
	and shaping the evolution of scientific publishing.},

	an existing method based on pooling the output of multiple
	
	manual searches is re-examined: testing a wider range of
	
	searchers and retrieval systems than has been examined before.
	
	Third, a new approach is explored where the ranked output of a
	
	single automatic search on a single retrieval system is assessed for
	
	relevance: no pooling whatsoever. Using established techniques
	
	for evaluating the quality of relevance judgments, in all three
	
	cases, test collections are formed that are as good as TREC.},

	the randomized response technique (RRT) and by conventional anonymous
	questionnaire methods. RRT is a survey method that permits sensitive
	information to be collected but that precludes associating the respondent
	with a particular response to a survey item. The estimated proportions
	of students who have engaged in cheating behaviors were, in general,
	larger using RRT. Moreover, this result is consistent with earlier
	findings for other sensitive behaviors. That underreporting is a
	serious problem with anonymous questionnaires is supported by the
	fact that the anonymous questionnaire estimates ranged from 39% to
	83% below the RRT estimates. Furthermore, using a covariate modification
	of RRT, there was a distinct inverse relation between students' estimated
	grade-point average and the tendency to engage in cheating behavior.
	While these results have direct implications for estimating cheating
	behavior in higher education, more broadly, they raise serious concerns
	about the use of anonymous questionnaires when survey topics are
	sensitive.},

	time algorithm for approximating the EMD for low dimensional histograms
	using the sum of absolute values of the weighted wavelet coefficients
	of the difference histogram. EMD computation is a special case of
	the Kantorovich-Rubinstein transshipment problem, and we exploit
	the Holder continuity constraint in its dual form to convert it into
	a simple optimization problem with an explicit solution in the wavelet
	domain. We prove that the resulting wavelet EMD metric is equivalent
	to EMD, i.e. the ratio of the two is bounded. We also provide estimates
	for the bounds. The weighted wavelet transform can be computed in
	time linear in the number of histogram bins, while the comparison
	is about as fast as for normal Euclidean distance or chi2 statistic.
	We experimentally show that wavelet EMD is a good approximation to
	EMD, has similar performance, but requires much less computation.},

	method in comparing a potential plagiarized document against a repository
	of legal or original documents to identify plagiarism activities.
	This approach is not scalable due to the potentially large number
	of original documents and the large number of sentences in each document.
	Furthermore, the security level of existing mechanisms is quite weak;
	a plagiarized document could simply by-pass the detection mechanisms
	by performing a minor modification on each sentence. In this paper,
	we propose a copy detection mechanism that will eliminate unnecessary
	comparisons. This is based on the observation that comparisons between
	two documents addressing different subjects are not necessary. We
	describe the design and implementation of our experimental prototype
	called CHECK. The results of some exploratory experiments will be
	illustrated and the security level of our mechanism will be discussed.},

	Um die A ̈ hnlichkeiten zwischen ihnen berechnen zu ko ̈nnen, werden

	are different from those inherent in scholarly standards for proper

	of Web-based electron publication has created new contexts for both
	piracy and plagiarism. In so far as piracy and plagiarism are confused,
	we cannot appreciate how the Web has changed the importance of these
	very different types of wrongs. The present paper argues that Web-based
	publication lessens the importance of piracy, while it heightens
	the need for protections against plagiarism. Copyright policy protects
	the opportunity for publishers to make a profit from their investments.
	As the cost of publication decreases in the electronic media, we
	need fewer copyright protections. Plagiarism is the failure to abide
	by scholarly standards for citation of sources. These standards assure
	us that information can be verified and traced to its source. Since
	Web sources are often volatile and changing, it becomes increasingly
	difficult and important to have clear standards for verifying the

	authorship verification and survey the state of the art. (2) We show
	how the meta learning approach of Koppel and Schler, termed unmasking

	community. Now most common text plagiarism occurs by making a variety
	of minor alterations that include the insertion, deletion, or substitution
	of words. Such simple changes, however, require excessive string
	comparisons. In this paper, we present a hybrid plagiarism detection
	method. We investigate the use of a diagonal line, which is derived
	from Levenshtein distance, and simplified Smith-Waterman algorithm
	that is a classical tool in the identification and quantification
	of local similarities in biological sequences, with a view to the
	application in the plagiarism detection. Our approach avoids globally
	involved string comparisons and considers psychological factors,
	which can yield significant speed-up by experiment results. Based
	on the results, we indicate the practicality of such improvement
	using Levenshtein distance and Smith-Waterman algorithm and to illustrate
	the efficiency gains. In the future, it would be interesting to explore
	appropriate heuristics in the area of text comparison.},

	used to find duplicate biomedical publications in MEDLINE. Full text
	articles are becoming increasingly available, yet the similarities
	among them have not been systematically studied. Here, we quantitatively
	investigated the full text similarity of biomedical publications
	in PubMed Central.<p> <sec><sec> <title>MethodologyPrincipal Findings<title>
	<p>72,011 full text articles from PubMed Central (PMC) were parsed
	to generate three different datasets: full texts, sections, and paragraphs.
	Text similarity comparisons were performed on these datasets using
	the text similarity algorithm eTBLAST. We measured the frequency
	of similar text pairs and compared it among different datasets. We
	found that high abstract similarity can be used to predict high full
	text similarity with a specificity of 20.1% (95% CI [17.3%, 23.1%])
	and sensitivity of 99.999%. Abstract similarity and full text similarity
	have a moderate correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient: âˆ’0.423)
	when the similarity ratio is above 0.4. Among pairs of articles in
	PMC, method sections are found to be the most repetitive (frequency
	of similar pairs, methods: 0.029, introduction: 0.0076, results:
	0.0043). In contrast, among a set of manually verified duplicate
	articles, results are the most repetitive sections (frequency of
	similar pairs, results: 0.94, methods: 0.89, introduction: 0.82).
	Repetition of introduction and methods sections is more likely to
	be committed by the same authors (odds of a highly similar pair having
	at least one shared author, introduction: 2.31, methods: 1.83, results:
	1.03). There is also significantly more similarity in pairs of review
	articles than in pairs containing one review and one nonreview paper
	(frequency of similar pairs: 0.0167 and 0.0023, respectively).<p>
	<sec><sec> <title>ConclusionSignificance<title> <p>While quantifying
	abstract similarity is an effective approach for finding duplicate
	citations, a comprehensive full text analysis is necessary to uncover
	all potential duplicate citations in the scientific literature and
	is helpful when establishing ethical guidelines for scientific publications.<p>

	often untenable situations we, as teachers, face when dealing with
	student plagiarism issues. In this article, I examine the dilemmas
	English for Academic Purposes (EAP) staff face when dealing with
	student plagiarism in the tertiary classroom. The perceptions of
	all 11 teachers involved in teaching a first year EAP writing subject
	at South-Coast University are detailed in light of the university's
	policy on plagiarism. My research indicates that not only is an agreed
	definition of plagiarism difficult to reach by members of staff teaching
	the same subject, but plagiarism is a multi-layered phenomenon encompassing
	a spectrum of human intention. Evaluating the spectrum can lead to
	differences in the implementation of university plagiarism policy,
	the result of which embodies issues of equity. The aim of the article
	is to encourage policy-makers and academic staff to acknowledge the
	concerns about implementation of plagiarism policy. Collaborative,
	cross-disciplinary re-thinking of plagiarism is needed to reach workable
	solutions.},

	systems. The three main classes that have been investigated are the
	exact-match, vector space and probabilistic models. The retrieval
	effectiveness of strategies based on these models has been evaluated
	experimentally, but there has been little in the way of comparison
	in terms of their formal properties. In this paper we introduce a
	recent form of the probabilistic model based on inference networks,
	and show how the vector space and exact-match can be described in
	this framework. Differences between these models can be explained
	as differences in the estimation of probabilities, both in the initial
	search and during relevance feedback.},

	distance (EMD) to evaluate document similarity by allowing many-to-many
	matching between subtopics. First, each document is decomposed into
	a set of subtopics, and then the EMD is employed to evaluate the
	similarity between two sets of subtopics for two documents by solving
	the transportation problem. The proposed measure is an improvement
	of the previous OM-based measure, which allows only one-to-one matching
	between subtopics. Experiments have been performed on the TDT3 dataset
	to evaluate existing similarity measures and the results show that
	the EMD-based measure outperforms the optimal matching (OM) based
	measure and all other measures. In addition to the TextTiling algorithm,
	the sentence clustering algorithm is adopted for document decomposition,
	and the experimental results show that the proposed EMD-based measure
	does not rely on the document decomposition algorithm and thus it
	is more robust than the OM-based measure.},

	Office, 37,900 professors were teaching and researching at German
	institutions of higher education at the end of 2006. While their
	total number has remained almost unchanged since the mid-1990s, the
	proportion of female profess ors has risen steadily since 1995. The
	share of women holding profes sorships increased from 8 % to 15 %
	over that period, with the number of female profes sors reaching
	a new record level of some 5,700 in 2006. At the end of 2006, a total
	of about 501,400 pers ons were employed at German institutions of
	higher education. That was an increase of 4,200 employees or 0.8
	% compared with the year before. Around 254,200 persons (51 % of
	the staff) worked in the non-scientific areas s uch as adminis tration,

	impact and quality of their scholarly publications. While all academic
	institutions look to publication counts and venues as well as the
	subjective opinions of peers, many hiring, tenure, and promotion
	committees also rely on citation analysis to obtain a more objective
	assessment of an author’s work. Consequently, faculty members try
	to identify as many citations to their published works as possible
	to provide a comprehensive assessment of their publication impact
	on the scholarly and professional communities. The Institute for
	Scientific Information’s (ISI) citation databases, which are widely
	used as a starting point if not the only source for locating citations,
	have several limitations that may leave gaps in the coverage of citations
	to an author’s work. This paper presents a case study comparing citations

  abstract = {Motivation: Clustering MEDLINE documents is usually conducted by the
	vector space model, which computes the content similarity between
	two documents by basically using the inner-product of their word
	vectors. Recently the semantic information of MeSH (Medical Subject
	Headings) thesaurus is being applied to clustering MEDLINE documents
	by mapping documents into MeSH concept vectors to be clustered. However,
	current approaches of using MeSH thesaurus have two serious limitations:
	First, important semantic information may be lost when generating
	MeSH concept vectors, and second, the content information of the
	original text has been discarded.Methods: Our new strategy includes
	three key points. First, we develop a sound method for measuring
	the semantic similarity between two documents over the MeSH thesaurus.
	Second, we combine both the semantic and content similarities to
	generate the integrated similarity matrix between documents. Third,
	we apply a spectral approach to clustering documents over the integrated
	similarity matrix.Results: Using various 100 datasets of MEDLINE
	records, we conduct extensive experiments with changing alternative
	measures and parameters. Experimental results show that integrating
	the semantic and content similarities outperforms the case of using
	only one of the two similarities, being statistically significant.
	We further find the best parameter setting which is consistent over
	all experimental conditions conducted. We finally show a typical
	example of resultant clusters, confirming the effectiveness of our
	strategy in improving MEDLINE document clustering.},

	developed within the AXMEDIS project. The algorithm leverages the
	plagiarist behaviour, which is modeled as a combination of 3 basical
	actions: insertion, deletion, substitution. We recognize that this
	behaviour may occur at various level of the document structure: the
	plagiarist may insert, delete or substitute a word, period or a paragraph.
	The procedure consists in two main steps: document structure extraction
	and plagiarism function calculation. We propose a recursive plagiarism
	evaluation function to be evaluated at each level of the document
	structure which is based on the Levenshtein edit distance. We also
	propose a method that will eliminate unnecessary chunks comparison,
	avoiding similarity calculation of chunks which do not share enough
	4-grams. We describe the similarity algorithm and discuss some implementation
	issues and future work},
