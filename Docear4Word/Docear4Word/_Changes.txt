v1.30
- A database parsing error during Refresh now displays message with line and column information.
- Citation Key:
  - Changing to the official spec of allowed characters was causing too many problems for existing libraries.
    - '<', '>', '&', '%', '{', '}', ',', '"' plus whitespace characters are now disallowed but any other char is valid
    - An apostrophe "'" *is* allowed in the database but is removed from the Name before use rather than treat it as invalid. 
      This was always the case since v1.0 so we must continue this (rather than replacing it with '`' say)
      because existing citations may be using a Key with the apostrophe stripped out.
- Some optimizations have been made so that moving through a large document with many fields isn't slow
  - When the Reference tab is selected (and the Docear4Word buttons need to be updated), Docear4Word now makes the minimum
	  number of checks necessary. It is still slower towards the end of a large document than the beginning but much improved
		over previous versions.
  - When the Reference tab is not selected, Docear4Word makes no checks and so cursor movement is at full speed regardless
	  of position in the document.
