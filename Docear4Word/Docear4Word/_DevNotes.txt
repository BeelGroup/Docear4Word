v1.30
- We now only update when the References Tab is selected and just set a flag when it isn't
  - The OnRefreshPropertyChanging event will check the flag and then arrange a full update
	  when necessary
- Updating state is now only done when necessary since Word doesn't perform a NOP when the value is the same
- AccessibleHelper added to be able to detected when the References tab is selected
- GetCSLFields now split into two
  - GetAllCSLFields which was the original functionality (though not used now)
	- GetMaxTwoSelectedCSLFields which is optimized to find 0, 1, or 2 fields within a specified range
	  - We don't need to know how many fields - just whether there is 0, 1 or multiple
		  so this is faster then before although is slower when the selection range is at the end of a document
			since it still has to read Fields from the start.
			** There may be an opportunity to speed this up by doing a binary chop on the Fields list **
- SelectionManager moved to its own file
  - Now uses GetMaxTwoSelectedCSLFields and caches the results
	- Uses more specific properties when setting state

v1.23
- Can't prevent Cursor.Wait since it is already set to that by the time we get control
  - Just reset to I-Beam
- Bit difficult to preserve lexer info when exception thrown
  - Store last exception so it can be picked up later
- Name token
  - Now uses original spec (not sure where from) to allow funny chars to be included

v1.21
- '-' as the page caused problems - now ignored.
